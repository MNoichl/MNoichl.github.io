Tournes<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>Diagrams have played an important role throughout the entire history of differential equations. Geometrical intuition, visual thinking, experimentation on diagrams, conceptions of algorithms and instruments to construct these diagrams, heuristic proofs based on diagrams, have interacted with the development of analytical abstract theories. We aim to analyze these interactions during the two centuries the classical theory of differential equations was developed. They are intimately connected to the difficulties faced in defining what the solution of a differential equation is and in describing the global behavior of such a solution.','<b>Title: </b>Towards a semantics for the artifactual theory of fiction and beyond<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> M.

As our starting point we take Thomassons realist theory of literary fictional objects, according to which such objects actually exist, albeit as abstract and artifactual entities. Thomassons approach relies heavily on the notion of ontological dependence, but its precise semantics has not yet been developed. Moreover, the modal approach to the notion of ontological dependence underlying the Artifactual Theory has recently been contested by several scholars. The main aims of this paper are i to develop a semantic approach to the notion of ontological dependence in the context of the Artifactual Theory of fiction, and in so doing bridge a number of philosophical and logical gaps; ii to generalize Thomassons categorial theory of ontological dependence by reconstructing ontological categories of entities purely in terms of different structures of ontological dependence, rather than in terms of the basic kinds of entities the categorical entities depend on.','<b>Title: </b>Platonic thought experiments: how on earth<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> R.

Thought experiments in the natural science, 1991a, 1991b; Contemporary debates in philosophy of science, 2004; Thought experiments, 2008 argues that thought experiments TE in science cannot be arguments and cannot even be represented by arguments. He rest his case on examples of TEs which proceed through a contradiction to reach a positive resolution Brown calls such TEs platonic. This, supposedly, makes it impossible to represent them as arguments for logical reasons: there is no logic that can adequately model such phenomena. Brown further argues that this being the case, platonic TEs provide us with irreducible insight into the abstract realm of laws of nature. I argue against this approach by describing how platonic TEs can be modeled within the logical framework of adaptive proofs for prioritized consequence operations. To show how this mundane apparatus works, I use it to reconstruct one of the key examples used by Brown, Galileos TE involving falling bodies.','<b>Title: </b>Interpretations without justification: a general argument against Morgans Canon<br><b>Year: </b>2017<br><b>Author: </b> T.

According to this principle we should always prefer explanations of animal behavior in terms of lower psychological processes over explanations in terms of higher psychological processes, when alternative explanations are possible. The validity of the principle depends on two things, a clear understanding of what it means for psychological processes to be higher or lower relative to each other 1 and a justification of a general preference for explanations that refer to lower psychological abilities 2. However, I argue that we cannot spell out the idea of a psychological scale in a way that claim 2 is satisfied. I start with the discussion of different interpretations of the notion of a psychological scale Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, I discuss different possible strategies to justify any of those interpretations and argue that all of them fail. Finally, in Sect. 4, I generalize the argument for all possible interpretations of Morgans Canon and propose an alternative strategy: We should base our interpretations of animal behavior on more general principles such as evidential support and explanatory power, as followed in other scientific domains.','<b>Title: </b>Melia and Saatsi on structural realism<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> Z.

However, ambiguity in the definition of structure allows for versions that do not succumb to Newmans objection. In this paper, I consider some versions of SR that maintain an abstract notion of structure yet avoid Newmans objection. In particular, I consider versions suggested by Melia and Saatsi. They reject a solution that restricts the domain of the second-order quantifiers, and argue in favor of buttressing the language with intensional operators such as it is physically necessary that....

My account is distinctive in a number of ways, one of which is that it is compatible with the truth of externalism-the view that the contents of subjects intentional states are individuation-dependent on factors external to their minds. It is thus decidedly anti-Cartesian, despite being introspectionist. My argument proceeds in three stages. A virtue of the position I develop is that the epistemic features on which it is based also apply to sensations and to non-episodic intentional states, to the extent that one has authoritative knowledge of them. However, despite the appeal to analogies with observable properties of objects of perception, the account is not a perceptual model of such knowledge in the sense that those such as Shoemaker, Burge and others have in mind. Because the features on which the analogy is based are abstract and general, they are not tied to cases of observation alone. Those who appeal to such phenomena as intellectual experience Burge, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 96, 91-116, 1996 or intellectual intuition Bealer, Philosophical perspectives, Cambridge, MA: Basil Blackwell, 29-55, 1999 in their accounts of authoritative self-knowledge may well appeal to such features. This, amongst other factors, distinguishes the position from other introspectionist ones in a way that makes it immune to standard objections to perceptual models of self-knowledge.','<b>Title: </b>Levin and Ghins on the no miracle argument and naturalism<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> M.

Hence, the NMA can be considered scientific in the sense that it hinges on a scientific explanation, it follows a typically scientific inferential pattern IBE, and it is based on an empirical fact the success of science. Scientific realism, in turn, is scientific in the sense that it is supported both by a meta-level scientific argument the NMA, and by first level scientific arguments through semantic ascent and generalization. However, both the NMA and scientific realism are not purely scientific, since they go beyond properly scientific concerns, and require additional philosophical reasoning. In turn, naturalism is correct in the sense that philosophy is continuous with science, partly based on it, and potentially equally well warranted. Beside denying the scientific nature of the NMA, Ghins raises some objections to its cogency, to which I reply in the final section.','<b>Title: </b>Generic Generalizations in Science: A Bridge to Everyday Language<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> F.

Four arguments are presented to support this thesis. One argument is that the interpretation in terms of ceteris paribus laws is a historical accident. The other three arguments draw on similarities between these generalizations and archetypal generics: they come with similar inferential commitments, they share a syntactic form, and the existing theories to make sense of them are alike. Once these generalizations are properly understood as generics, the recent cognitive approach to generics can be extended to the study of the relevant sciences. The last section indicates ways in which this extension is fruitful for the two strands of research that we combine: the philosophy of science literature on generalizations and the semantics literature on generics.','<b>Title: </b>Ceteris Paribus and Ceteris Rectis Laws: Content and Causal Role<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> G.

It also makes it easy to define an iterative schema for tense that allows for multiple points of reference, a possibility noted by Prior and demanded by Comrie, and we sketch how this schema can be generalized to a shift-and-restrict pattern in which special propositional symbols for adverbials and indexicals act as restrictors on the range of tense operators.','<b>Title: </b>A uniform semantics for embedded interrogatives: an answer, not necessarily the answer<br><b>Year: </b>2015<br><b>Author: </b> B.

We show that this rule allows us to derive veridical and non-veridical readings of embedded questions, depending on whether the embedding verb is veridical or not, and provide novel empirical evidence supporting the generalization.

Lets suppose that we become aware of a fact and some potential explanations thereof. Lets also suppose that we would like to believe the truth. Given this aim, we can ask two questions. First, is it likely that one of these hypotheses is true Second, given an affirmative answer to the first question, which one is it likely to be Inference to the best explanation IBE offers answers to both questions. To the first, it says YesaEuroassuming that at least one of the hypotheses would, if true, provide a satisfactory explanation of the fact under consideration. To the second, it says that the hypothesis most likely to be true is the one that scores best on the explanatory virtues: conservatism, modesty, simplicity, generality, and predictive power. Many philosophers have argued against IBEs answer to the first question. I am interested in an objection to its answer to the second. Many philosophers seem to think that it is unsustainable: they seem to think that even if we assume that one of the competing hypotheses is true, we should not think that IBE will help us to identify it. Or, more carefully, if these philosophers are doing what they appear to be doing-namely, offering critiques of IBE that dont depend on assumptions about the field of competing hypotheses-then their claim is that IBE will not help us to identify the truth. I believe that this is mistaken: the argument for believing it assumes a model of IBE that we have no reason to accept.','<b>Title: </b>The kinematics of belief and desire<br><b>Year: </b>2007<br><b>Author: </b> R.

This paper aims to connect them by developing kinematical models for the study of preference change and practical deliberation. Preference change is treated in a manner analogous to Jeffreys handling of belief change: not as mechanical outputs of combinations of intrinsic desires plus information, but as a matter of judgement and of making up ones mind. In the first section Jeffreys probability kinematics is motivated and extended to the treatment of changes in conditional belief. In the second, analogous kinematical models are developed for preference change and in particular belief-induced change that depends on an invariance condition for conditional preference. The two are the brought together in the last section in a tentative model of pratical deliberation.','<b>Title: </b>Representations gone mental<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> A.

The structural representations that these theorists champion are said to count as representations by virtue of functioning as internal models of distal systems. In his 2007 book, Representation Reconsidered, William Ramsey endorses the structural conception of mental representation, but uses it to develop a novel argument against representationalism, the widespread view that cognition essentially involves the manipulation of mental representations. Ramsey argues that although theories within the classical tradition of cognitive science once posited structural representations, these theories are being superseded by newer theories, within the tradition of connectionism and cognitive neuroscience, which rarely if ever appeal to structural representations. Instead, these theories seem to be explaining cognition by invoking so-called receptor representations, which, Ramsey claims, arent genuine representations at all-despite being called representations, these mechanisms function more as triggers or causal relays than as genuine stand-ins for distal systems. I argue that when the notions of structural and receptor representation are properly explicated, there turns out to be no distinction between them. There only appears to be a distinction between receptor and structural representations because the latter are tacitly conflated with the mental models ostensibly involved in offline cognitive processes such as episodic memory and mental imagery. While structural representations might count as genuine representations, they arent distinctively mental representations, for they can be found in all sorts of non-intentional systems such as plants. Thus to explain the kinds of offline cognitive capacities that have motivated talk of mental models, we must develop richer conceptions of mental representation than those provided by the notions of structural and receptor representation.','<b>Title: </b>Optogenetics and the mechanism of false memory<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> Sk.

The view is motivated by the memory errors discovered in cognitive psychology. Little has been known about the neural mechanisms by which false memories are produced. Recently, using a method I call the Optogenetic False Memory Technique O-FaMe, neuroscientists have created false memories in mice e.g., Ramirez et al., in Science 341:388-391, 2013. In this paper, I examine how Constructivism fares in light of O-FaMe results. My aims are two-fold. First, I argue that errors found in O-FaMe and cognitive psychology are similar behaviorally. Second, Constructivists should be able to explain the former since they purport to explain the latter, but they cannot. I conclude that O-FaMe studies reveal details about the mechanism by which false memories are produced that are incompatible with the explanatory approach to false memories favored by Constructivism.','<b>Title: </b>The organism in development<br><b>Year: </b>2000<br><b>Author: </b> Rc.

The organism is pulled in divergent directions: on the one hand, there is an important body of work that emphasizes the role of the gene in development, as executing and controlling embryological change; on the other hand, there are more theoretical approaches under which the organism disappears as little more than an instance for testing biological generalizations. I press here for the ineliminability of the organism in developmental biology on explanatory grounds. I examine classical work concerned with growth and development, particularly in Drosophila and C. elegans. Some of this work is suggestive of modular development, and accordingly suggests a level below that of the organism as being explanatory. These are not the only type of case. There are other equally well-established results, which indicate greater integration in the developing organism. Though with a modular organization the organism can be thought of as made up of its constituent traits, and though the explanations of these traits may lie in terms of cells or genes, even with modular development the explanations of genetic differences require an appeal to the organism. With non-modular organization the organism has an even more central role. This does not mean that these genetic or cellular contributions are unreal in any way, or that development requires some sort of vitalistic contribution; but the genetic contributions make sense only as constituents of the organism, embedded in a larger organic context.','<b>Title: </b>Perceiving tropes<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> B.

My aim is to work out the least problematic version of the representational view of perception that preserves the most important considerations in favor of the relational view. According to this version of representationalism, the properties represented in perception are tropes-abstract particulars that are logically incapable of being present in two distinct individuals at the same time.

I suggest an alternative account which, however, cannot play a role in a Searle-type argument, and argue that Searle gives no good reason for favoring his account, which allows the abstract argument to work, over the alternative, which doesnt.

In this paper I discuss how the distinction between assertibility and truth-conditions can be applied to explain this phenomenon.

Once probabilities on the agents evidence are introduced into epistemic logic in a very natural way, it is easy to construct models of improbable knowing, some of which have realistic interpretations, for instance concerning agents like us with limited powers of perceptual discrimination. Improbable knowing is an extreme case of failure of the KK principle, that is, of a case of knowing something even though one does not know at the time that one knows that thing. A generalization of the argument yields cases of improbable rationality, in which it is rational for one to do something even though it is almost certain on ones evidence at the time that it is not rational for one to do that thing. When the models are elaborated to represent appearances and beliefs as well as knowledge, they turn out to contain Gettier cases. Neglect of the possibility of improbable knowing may cause some sceptical claims and claims of the non-closure of knowledge under competent deduction to look more plausible than they deserve to. A formal appendix explores the closely related question of the conditions under which a reflection principle is violated. The principle says that the evidential probability of a proposition conditional on the evidential probability of that propositions being c is itself c.','nan','<b>Title: </b>Ontological butchery: Organism concepts and biological generalizations<br><b>Year: </b>2000<br><b>Author: </b> Ja.

While their arguments might be valid under certain assumptions, they overlook a possible way to make sense of the distinction. Whether selection and drift can be thought of as causally distinct, I argue, depends on the source of probabilities in natural selection. In particular, if the probabilities used in defining fitness values are at least partly a result of abstracting from or ignoring certain features of the environment, then selection and drift might in fact be causally distinct.','<b>Title: </b>Contingent objects and the Barcan Formula Bernard Linsky, Edward Zalta, Timothy Williamson<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> R.

All objects exist necessarily; some - those we would usually consider contingent - are concrete at some worlds and non-concrete but still existent at others. Linsky and Zalta refer to such objects as contingently nonconcrete. I defend the standard usage of the word exists, and the view that many objects exist only contingently. I argue that the Linsky/Zalta analysis, and to a lesser extent Williamsons, suffers not only from a peculiar ontology but also from two related formal difficulties. Their analysis gives either counter-intuitive or ad hoc results about essences, and it fails to accommodate contingently existing abstracta.','<b>Title: </b>Reproduction in Complex Life Cycles: Toward a Developmental Reaction Norms Perspective<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> J.

The account is further generalized to allow for agents with incomplete information. The article ends with a discussion of known limitations of preference-based accounts of values and how these might be overcome by accounting for parity and essential incompleteness. It is also shown that one intuitively compelling notion of disagreement does not give rise to a proper distance measure.','<b>Title: </b>Warfare and western manufactures: A case study of explanation in anthropology<br><b>Year: </b>1998<br><b>Author: </b> D.

We have a collection L of locations and a collection S of statements such that a statement may be evaluated for truth at each location. Typically one and the same statement may be true at one location and false at another. Given this semantic framework we may proceed in two ways: introducing names for locations, predicates for the relations among them and an at preposition to express the value of statements at locations; or introduce statement operators which do not name locations but whose truth-conditional effect depends on the truth or falsity of embedded statements at various locations. The latter is akin to Priors approach to tense logic. In any logic of location there will be some basic operators which we can define. By ringing the changes on the topology of locations, different logical systems may be generated, and the challenge for the logician is then in each case to find operators, axioms and rules yielding a proof theory adequate to the semantics. The generality of the approach is illustrated with familiar and not so familiar examples from modal, tense and place logic, mathematics, and even the logic of games.','<b>Title: </b>Inference to the best explanation, coherence and other explanatory virtues<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Ill introduce his reasons for claiming that the distinction between cause and effect on an interventionist account is perspectival. Then Ill introduce a distinction between different ways in which a class of concepts can be said to depend on facts about their users. Three importantly different forms of dependence will emerge from the discussion: 1 Pragmatic dependence on us: truth conditions for x-beliefs can be given by a function f of more fundamental physical structures making no explicit reference to human agents. But there are any other number of functions  ontologically on a par with x and what explains the distinguished role f plays in our practical and epistemic lives are facts about us. 2 Implicit relativization: truth conditions for x-beliefs are relative to agent or context; the context supplies the value of a hidden parameter hidden in the sense that it is not explicitly represented in the surface syntax that determines the truth of x-beliefs. 3 Indexicals: like implicit relativization except that the surface syntax contains a term whose semantic value is context-dependent. I suggest that Prices insights are best understood in the first way. This will draw a crucial disanalogy with his central examples of perspectival concepts, but it will refine the thesis in a way that is more faithful to what his arguments show. The refined thesis will also support generalization to other concepts, and clarify the foundations of the quite distinctive research program that Price has been developing for a number of years.','<b>Title: </b>How questions and the manner-method distinction<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> Kj.

In addition, ideas can represent impressions and other ideas. However, he explicitly rejects the view that ideas are inherently representational, and he implicitly adopts a view according to which things whether mental or non-mental represent in virtue of playing, through the production of mental effects and dispositions, a significant part of the causal and/or functional role of what they represent.

In this paper we provide an interpretation of such a process comparing it with what is nowadays considered the standard measurement theory, i.e., representational theory of measurement. It is maintained here that this theory has its own merits but it is incomplete and too abstract, its main weakness being the scant attention reserved to the empirical side of measurement, i.e., to measurement systems and to the ways in which the interactions of such systems with the entities under measurement provide a structure to an empirical domain. In particular it is claimed that 1 it is on the ground of the interaction with a measurement system that a partition can be induced on the domain of entities under measurement and that relations among such entities can be established, and that 2 it is the usage of measurement systems that guarantees a degree of objectivity and intersubjectivity to measurement results. As modeled in this paper, measurement systems link the abstract theory of measuring, as developed in representational terms, and the practice of measuring, as coded in standard documents such as the International Vocabulary of Metrology.','<b>Title: </b>The ontology of theoretical modelling: models as make-believe<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Hence, ranking theory with its resources of defeasible reasoning seems ideally suited to explicate these points in a formal way. This is what the paper attempts to do. Thus it will turn out that a law is simply the deterministic analogue of a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables.

While these patterns must often be represented in addition to descriptions of operations in order to explain a phenomenon, they are not equivalent to generalizations because their explanatory role does not depend on any specific facts about their scope or domain of invariance.','<b>Title: </b>Mathematical determinacy and the transferability of aboutness<br><b>Year: </b>2007<br><b>Author: </b> S.

Philosophers of science increasingly view nomological methods as inappropriate for the special sciences like psychology and biology, which has led to a surge of interest in approaches to natural kinds that are more obviously compatible with mechanistic and model-based methods, especially homeostatic property cluster theory. But can the functionalist approach to kinds be weaned off its dependency on laws Dan Weiskopf has recently offered a reboot of the functionalist program by replacing its nomological commitments with a model-based approach more closely derived from practice in psychology. Roughly, Weiskopf holds that the natural kinds of psychology will be the functional properties that feature in many empirically successful cognitive models, and that those properties need not be localizable to parts of an underlying mechanism. I here skeptically examine the three modeling practices that Weiskopf thinks introduce such non-localizable properties: fictionalization, reification, and functional abstraction. In each case, I argue that recognizing functional properties introduced by these practices as autonomous kinds comes at clear cost to those explanations counterfactual explanatory power. At each step, a tempting functionalist response is parochialism: to hold that the false or omitted counterfactuals fall outside the modelers explanatory aims, and so should not be counted against functional kinds. I conclude by noting the dangers this attitude poses to scientific disagreement, inviting functionalists to better articulate how the individuation conditions for functional kinds might outstrip the perspective of a single modeler.','<b>Title: </b>The disvalue of knowledge<br><b>Year: </b><br><b>Author: </b> D.

Beebe for how to solve the generality problem for process reliabilism. The proposal is highlighted by Alvin I. Goldman as an interesting candidate solution. However, Goldman raises the worry that the proposal may not always yield a determinate result. We address this worry by proving a dilemma: either the statistical approach does not yield a determinate result or it leads to trivialization, i.e. reliability collapses into truth and anti-reliability into falsehood. Various strategies for avoiding this predicament are considered, including revising the statistical rule or restricting its application to natural kinds. All amendments are seen to have serious problems of their own. We conclude that reliabilists need to look elsewhere for a convincing solution to the generality problem.','<b>Title: </b>Laws and dispositions<br><b>Year: </b>1998<br><b>Author: </b> A.

This paper examines the prospects of generalizing expressivism to taste. This application has much initial plausibility. Many of the standard arguments used in favor of moral expressivism seem to apply to taste. For example, it seems conceivable that you and I disagree about whether chocolate is delicious although we dont disagree about the facts, which suggests that taste judgments are noncognitive attitudes rather than beliefs. However, there is also a striking difference between moral disagreements and disagreements about taste. Faced with a moral disagreement, we intuit that at least either party is at fault. Disagreements about taste, by contrast, are occurrences where neither party intuitively is at fault. This leads to a dilemma. On the one hand, if a disagreement in attitude is not intuited as faultless, then it seems implausible if applied to taste. If, on the other hand, a disagreement in attitude is a disagreement that we intuit as faultless, then it seems implausible if applied to the moral domain. The aim of this paper is to examine how an expressivist can avoid this dilemma.','<b>Title: </b>CONCEPTUAL REALISM VERSUS QUINE ON CLASSES AND HIGHER-ORDER LOGIC<br><b>Year: </b>1992<br><b>Author: </b> Nb.

We argue against Quines view that predicate quantifiers can be given a referential interpretation only if the entities predicates stand for on such an interpretation are the same as the classes assuming extensionality that nominalized predicates denote as singular terms.  Quines alternative of giving predicate quantifiers only a substitutional interpretation is compared with a constructive version of conceptual realism, which with a logic of nominalized predicates is compared with Quines description of conceptualism as a ramified theory of classes.  We argue against Quines implicit assumption that conceptualism cannot account for impredicative concept-formation and compare holistic conceptual realism with Quines class Platonism.','nan','<b>Title: </b>Bent, Not Broken: Why Exemplification Simpliciter Remains a Problem for Eternalist Endurantism<br><b>Year: </b>2017<br><b>Author: </b> D.

The problem is how to make multiple parts interact such that they form a whole that is ultimately related to truth and falsity. The solution I propose is based on a Platonist variant of procedural semantics. I think of procedures as abstract entities that detail a logical path from input to output. Procedures are modeled on a function/argument logic, but are not functions mappings. Instead they are higher-order, fine-grained structures. I identify propositions with particular kinds of molecular procedures containing multiple sub-procedures as parts. Procedures are among the basic entities of my ontology, while propositions are derived entities. The core of a structured proposition is the procedure of predication, which is an instance of the procedure of functional application. The main thesis I defend is that procedurally conceived propositions are their own unifiers detailing how their parts interact so as to form a unit. They are not unified by one of their constituents, e.g., a relation or a sub-procedure, on pain of regress. The relevant procedural semantics is Transparent Intensional Logic, a hyperintensional, typed -calculus, whose -terms express four different kinds of procedures. While demonstrating how the theory works, I place my solution in a wider historical and systematic context.','<b>Title: </b>Explanation and understanding An alternative to Strevens Depth<br><b>Year: </b>2011<br><b>Author: </b> A.

This suggestion is simple but has far-reaching implications. It affects the status of explanations that cite multiply realizable properties; changes the explanatory role of causal factors with small effect; and undermines Strevens titular explanatory virtue, depth. This results in greater coherence with explanatory practice and accords with the emphasis that Strevens places on explanatory patterns.

We will examine the evidence that Kuhn and Feyerabend were verballed in this sense by their critics and that the role of the idea of incommensurability in their argumentation has been systematically misunderstood and -represented. In particular, we will see that neither Kuhn nor Feyerabend, despite what their critics often say about them, held that incommensurability of theories implies the rational incomparability of theories. This is especially clear in the case of Feyerabend, whose argument is NOT that theories in a scientific tradition are on occasion incommensurable, but, rather, that, when the relations of theories in a tradition are represented in a particular way, they may on occasion be incommensurable according to that representation and hence incomparable if that representation is taken as providing the mechanisms of comparison. And the point of this claim is not to establish something about science, but, rather, to establish something about the representations of science which yield this result i.e. that two theories might be incommensurable. Feyerabend in other words invokes incommensurability according to the standards of a particular representation as a reductio of that mode of representation. And this argument in fact depends precisely on the comparability of theories which are, according to the representation, incommensurable. Feyerabends argument is about the ways in which we should understand progress in science and he is concerned, in particular, to establish that a historically informed approach is superior to an approach which, if applicable, is applicable only to what he calls abstract traditions. Kuhns work, especially in the Postscript-1969, provides complementary materials, especially in relation to a collectivised and non-algorithmic account of theory choice across formally incommensurable paradigms.','<b>Title: </b>Grounding, conceivability, and the mind-body problem<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> H.

We characterize classical Bayesian inference in terms of a graphical property and demonstrate that our approach eliminates some purely conventional elements that appear in common representations thereof, such as whether degrees of belief are represented by probabilities or entropic quantities. We also introduce a quantum-like calculus wherein the Frobenius structure is noncommutative and show that it can accommodate Leifers calculus of conditional density operators. The notion of conditional independence is also generalized to our graphical setting and we make some preliminary connections to the theory of Bayesian networks.

This generalization broadens the theoretical boundaries of judgment aggregation by proving that, even if these nonmonotonic logics are employed, certain typical impossibility results still hold.','<b>Title: </b>Did Georg Cantor influence Edmund Husserl<br><b>Year: </b>1997<br><b>Author: </b> Co.

According to a standard reply, accounts of embodied cognition can explain only instances of cognition and agency that are not representation-hungry. Two main types of such representation-hungry phenomena have been discussed: cognition about the absent and about the abstract. Proponents of representationalism have maintained that a satisfactory account of such phenomena requires the ascription of mental representations. Opponents have denied this. I will argue that there is another important representation-hungry phenomenon that has been overlooked in this debate: temporally extended planning agency. In particular, I will argue that it is very difficult to see how planning agency can be explained without the ascription of mental representations, even if we grant, for the sake of argument, that cognition about the absent and abstract can. We will see that this is a serious challenge for the radical as well as the more modest anti-representationalist versions of embodied cognition, and we will see that modest anti-representationalism is an unstable position.','<b>Title: </b>Probabilities for multiple properties: The models of Hesse and Carnap and Kemeny<br><b>Year: </b>2001<br><b>Author: </b> P.

In the context of his platonism about musical works, in order for musical works to be audible, Julian Dodd argues that abstracta are causally efficacious in virtue of their concrete tokens participating in events. I attempt to provide a principled argument for the causal inertness of abstracta by first rejecting Dodds arguments from events, and then extending and generalizing the causal exclusion argument to the abstract/concrete distinction. For reasons of parsimony, if concrete tokens or instantiations of abstract objects account for all causal work, then there is no reason to attribute causal efficacy to abstracta, and thus reason to maintain their causal inertness. I then consider how one of the main arguments against causal exclusion, namely Stephen Yablos notion of proportionality, could be modified to support the causal efficacy of abstracta. I argue that from a few simple premises Yablos account in fact supports their causal inertness. Having a principled reason for the causal inertness of abstracta appears to entail that the musical platonist must admit that we never literally hear the musical work, but only its performances. I sketch a solution to this problem available to Dodd, so that the musical platonist can maintain that musical works are abstract objects and are causally inert while retaining their audibility.','<b>Title: </b>Generalization and Discovery by Assuming Conserved Mechanisms: Cross-Species Research on Circadian Oscillators<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> W.

To further understand these stochastic mechanisms, I take the general characterization of mechanism offered by MDC Philos Sci 761:1-25, 2000 and explore how it fits with several of the going philosophical accounts of chance: subjectivism, frequentism, Lewisian best-systems, and propensity. I argue that neither subjectivism, frequentism, nor a best-system-style interpretation of chance will give us what we need from an account of stochastic mechanism, but some version of propensity theory can. I then draw a few important lessons from recent propensity interpretations of fitness in order to present a novel propensity interpretation of stochastic mechanism according to which stochastic mechanisms are thought to have probabilistic propensities to produce certain outcomes over others. This understanding of stochastic mechanism, once fully fleshed-out, provides the benefits of 1 allowing the stochasticity of a particular mechanism to be an objective property in the world, a property investigable by science, 2 a way of quantifying the stochasticity of a particular mechanism, and 3 a way to avoid a problematic commitment to the causal efficacy of propensities and dispositional properties in general.','<b>Title: </b>ON THE SCOPE AND LIMITS OF GENERALIZATIONS IN THE SOCIAL-SCIENCES<br><b>Year: </b>1993<br><b>Author: </b> D.

It distinguishes between governing and phenomenal regularities, and argues that social regularities are phenomenal rather than governing. In place of nomological deductive arguments, the article maintains that social explanations depend on the discovery of casual mechanisms underlying various social processes. The metaphysical correlate of this argument is that there are no social kinds: types of social entities that share a common casual constitution giving rise to strong regularities of behavior. The article turns next to a consideration of the character of social causation and argues for a microfoundational interpretation of social causation: social causal powers are embodied in the constraints and opportunities that institutions present to individual agents. Finally, it is noted that these arguments have consequences for the credibility of social predictions: it is argued that predictions in social science are generally unreliable.','<b>Title: </b>How properties emerge<br><b>Year: </b>1997<br><b>Author: </b> P.

Van Ditmarsch<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>In belief revision a theory K is revised with a formula. resulting in a revised theory Kphi. Typically, -phi is in K, one has to give up belief in -phi by a process of retraction, and. is in Kphi. We propose to model belief revision in a dynamic epistemic logic. In this setting, we typically have an information state pointed Kripke model for the theory K wherein the agent believes the negation of the revision formula, i.e., wherein B-phi is true. The revision with. is a program phi that transforms this information state into a new information state. The transformation is described by a dynamic modal operator phi, that is interpreted as a binary relation phi between information states. The next information state is computed from the current information state and the belief revision formula. If the revision is successful, the agent believes. in the resulting state, i.e., B. is then true. To make this work, as information states we propose doxastic epistemic models that represent both knowledge and degrees of belief. These are multi-modal and multi-agent Kripke models. They are constructed from preference relations for agents, and they satisfy various characterizable multi-agent frame properties. Iterated, revocable, and higher-order belief revision are all quite natural in this setting. We present, for an example, five different ways of such dynamic belief revision. One can also see that as a non-deterministic epistemic action with two alternatives, where one is preferred over the other, and there is a natural generalization to general epistemic actions with preferences.','<b>Title: </b>Rethinking associations in psychology<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> M.

This position is novel in that it dissociates the veridicality of color attributions from the claim that physical objects are themselves colored. Thus, it is realist about color in both the semantic and epistemic senses, but not the ontic sense. The generality of this position is demonstrated by applying it to other secondary qualities, including heat, musical pitch, and odor. The basic argument proceeds by analogy with the theory of measurement. I argue that perceptual experiences are analogous to numerical structures in that they are suitable for measurement, but only report measured values after they have been linked to states of a measurement device via calibration. Since the calibration of our sensory apparatus varies with context, it is inappropriate to identify specific experiences with specific properties in the world. Rather, it is structural relations between possible experiences which represent relations between possible external properties, and it is at the level of these structural relationships that veridicality is appropriately assessed.','<b>Title: </b>AIMS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE REDUCTIONIST APPROACH IN BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR-BIOLOGY CELL BIOLOGY - A RESPONSE TO KINCAID<br><b>Year: </b>1992<br><b>Author: </b> Jd.

In light of Freges celebrated Sense-Determines-Reference principle, we find, however, that it is Beckers semantics, rather than Kripkes semantics, that has captured the true spirit of Freges semantic program. Furthermore, for Kripkes possible world semantics to fit in Freges framework of senses, worlds and referents, it will have to be thoroughly reformulated.

The resulting generalized Beckerian semantics provides, in effect, a Beckerian analysis of the Kripkean possible worlds.

This motivates an inquiry into the physical status of various concepts of localization. It is argued that a covariant generalization of Newton-Wigner localization is a physically illuminating concept. When analyzed in terms of nonlocally covariant quantum fields, creating and annihilating quanta in Newton-Wigner localized states, the vacuum is seen to not possess the spacelike superentanglement that the Reeh-Schlieder theorem displays relative to local fields, and to be locally empty as well as globally empty. Newton-Wigner localization is then shown to be physically interpretable in terms of a covariant generalization of the center of energy, the two localizations being identical if the system has no internal angular momentum. Finally, some of the counterintuitive features of Newton-Wigner localization are shown to have dose analogues in classical special relativity.','<b>Title: </b>The Generalization Problem and the Identity Solution<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> D.

Originally intended for mental properties alone, it did not take long for his critics to suggest the argument generalizes across all of the special science properties as well.

After a review of thought economy, its critics and some contemporary forms, the paper turns to the philosophical roots of Machs doctrine. Mach claimed that the simplest, most parsimonious theories economized memory and effort by using abstract concepts and laws instead of attending to the details of each individual event or experiment. For Mach, the individual case never truly repeated in all of its uniqueness, nor was all of the individual detail of a physical element adequately captured in abstract laws and schemata, however necessary these were for the pursuit of science. As can be shown from specific passages, some already published, some not, Machs elements included physical qualia in nature similar to Russells unsensed sensibilia, which existed even where there were no conscious observers. An argument will be presented to make the case that Mach believed in the mind-independent elements from the 1870s on, while other aspects of his thought evolved over time; I have thus dated the references to reflect this historical progression. I concentrate on Machs ontology, as it bears on economy of thought, not his epistemology per se, which might well have been restricted to observable elements/sensations. After his own conversion to neutral monism, in the 1920s, Bertrand Russell echoed Machs call for a future science capable of handling the intrinsic character of qualitative data directly without the excessive abstraction of physics.','<b>Title: </b>Folk psychology as science<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> M.

According to this tradition, law-statements take the form of generalizations, and the laws we find in well-established sciences are contingent and empirical; as such, if the kinds of generalizations at work in folk psychological explanations of human action act like definitions, or state conceptual connections, then such generalizations could not play the kind of explanatory role we find in mature sciences. This paper argues that the aforementioned way of framing the debate reflects a still powerful but impoverished conception of the role laws play in scientific explanations, a conception that, moreover, cannot be reconciled with a good deal of actual scientific practice. When we update the philosophy of science, we find the concerns that are raised for folk psychological explanations largely evaporate or are found not to be specific to such explanations.','<b>Title: </b>Representation: The problem for structuralism<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> Bc.

One popular position is that models represent fictional situations. Another position states that, though models often involve fictional elements, they represent real objects or scenarios. Though these two positions may seem to be incompatible, I believe it is possible to reconcile them. Using a threefold distinction between different signs proposed by Peirce, I develop an argument based on a proposal recently made by Kralemann and Lattman in Synthese 190:3397-3420, 2013 that shows that the two aforementioned positions can be reconciled by distinguishing different ways in which a model representation can be used. In particular, on the basis of Peirces distinction between icons, indices and symbols, I argue that models can sometimes function as icons, sometimes as indexes and sometimes as symbols, depending on the context in which they are considered and the use that they are developed for because they all have iconic, indexical and symbolic features. In addition, I show that conceiving models as signs enables us to develop an account of scientific representation that meets the main desiderata that Shech in Synthese 192:3463-3485, 2015 presents.','<b>Title: </b>Humes Big Brother: counting concepts and the bad company objection<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> Rt.

We can discern two questions of correctness about both kinds of induction: P1 what distinguishes those systems and classes of system that are projectible in Goodmans Fact, fiction and forecast, 1955 sense from those that are not, and P2 what are the methods by which we are able to identify kinds that are likely to be projectible In answer to the first question, numerous theories of natural kinds have been advanced, but none has satisfactorily addressed both questions simultaneously. I propose a shift in perspective. Both essentialist and cluster property theories have traditionally characterized kinds directly in terms of the causally salient properties their members possess. Instead, we should focus on dynamical symmetries, transformations of a system to which the causal structure of that system is indifferent. I suggest that to be a member of natural kind it is necessary and sufficient to possess a particular collection of dynamical symmetries. I show that membership in such a kind is in turn necessary and sufficient for the presence of the sort of causal structure that accounts for success in both kinds of induction, thus demonstrating that P1 has been answered satisfactorily. More dramatically, I demonstrate that this new theory of dynamical kinds provides an answer to P2 with methodological implications concerning the discovery of projectible kinds.','<b>Title: </b>Structures, dynamics and mechanisms in neuroscience: an integrative account<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> H.

Four examples shall support my points: the harmonic oscillator, the Haken-Kelso-Bunz model of bimanual coordination, the Watt governor and the Gierer-Meinhardt model of biological pattern formation.

With respect to the proofs in the Elements in particular, the received view is that Euclids reliance on geometric diagrams undermines his efforts to develop a gap-free deductive theory. The central difficulty concerns the generality of the theory. How can inferences made from a particular diagrams license general mathematical results After surveying the history behind the received view, this essay provides a contrary analysis by introducing a formal account of Euclids proofs, termed Eu. Eu solves the puzzle of generality surrounding Euclids arguments. It specifies what diagrams Euclids diagrams are, in a precise formal sense, and defines generality-preserving proof rules in terms of them. After the central principles behind the formalization are laid out, its implications with respect to the question of what does and does not constitute a genuine picture proof are explored.','<b>Title: </b>The Volterra Principle Generalized<br><b>Year: </b>2017<br><b>Author: </b> T.

The theory includes an intensional realism in which the intensional contents of predicable and referential concepts are represented through nominalized forms of the predicate and quantifier phrases that stand for those concepts. A central part of the theory distinguishes between active and deactivated referential concepts, where the latter are represented by nominalized quantifier phrases that occur as parts of complex predicates. Peter Geachs arguments against theories of general reference in Reference and Generality are used as a foil to test the adequacy of the theory. Geachs arguments are shown to either beg the question of general as opposed to singular reference or to be inapplicable because of the distinction between active and deactivated referential concepts.','<b>Title: </b>Display calculi and other modal calculi: a comparison<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> F.

Critics worry that this idea is metaphysically obscure at best, and at worst leads to panpsychism or animism. I examine the debate in detail, finding both confusion and illumination in the physical intentionalist thesis. Analysing a number of the canonical features of intentionality, I show that they all point to one overarching phenomenon of which both the mental and the physical are kinds, namely finality. This is the finality of final causes, the long-discarded idea of universal action for an end to which recent proponents of physical intentionality are in fact pointing whether or not they realise it. I explain finality in terms of the concept of specific indifference, arguing that in the case of the mental, specific indifference is realised by the process of abstraction, which has no correlate in the case of physical powers. This analysis, I conclude, reveals both the strength and weakness of rational creatures such as us, as well as demystifying albeit only partly the way in which powers work.','<b>Title: </b>Rationalizing two-tiered choice functions through conditional choice<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> J.

However, it has proven difficult to explain why DCNNs perform so well. In philosophy of mind, empiricists have long suggested that complex cognition is based on information derived from sensory experience, often appealing to a faculty of abstraction. Rationalists have frequently complained, however, that empiricists never adequately explained how this faculty of abstraction actually works. In this paper, I tie these two questions together, to the mutual benefit of both disciplines. I argue that the architectural features that distinguish DCNNs from earlier neural networks allow them to implement a form of hierarchical processing that I call transformational abstraction. Transformational abstraction iteratively converts sensory-based representations of category exemplars into new formats that are increasingly tolerant to nuisance variation in input. Reflecting upon the way that DCNNs leverage a combination of linear and non-linear processing to efficiently accomplish this feat allows us to understand how the brain is capable of bi-directional travel between exemplars and abstractions, addressing longstanding problems in empiricist philosophy of mind. I end by considering the prospects for future research on DCNNs, arguing that rather than simply implementing 80s connectionism with more brute-force computation, transformational abstraction counts as a qualitatively distinct form of processing ripe with philosophical and psychological significance, because it is significantly better suited to depict the generic mechanism responsible for this important kind of psychological processing in the brain.','<b>Title: </b>Bad company generalized<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> G.

Since such explanations yield beneficial trade-offs between stronger mathematical existential claims and fewer concrete ontological commitments than those involved in as it were merely good mathematical explanations, one must countenance the mathematical objects that play a theoretical role in them via an application of the relevant mathematical results. The nominalists challenge is thus to undermine the platonistic force of such explanations by way of alternative nominalistic ones. The authors contention is that such nominalistic explanations should provide a paraphrase of the proofs of the mathematical results being applied. There are reasons to doubt that proofs, construed here as formal derivations, actually contribute to the platonistc force to be undermined and, by parity, that nominalized proofs should bear responsability for the corresponding undermining. A discussion of two examples Bakers magicicadas, the hexagonal shape of honeycombs and of associated arguments by Lange, Pincock, Steiner and Tallant, point to a a wealth of worries concerning the construal of this explanatory role. Among those figure the distinction between the weak and strong role of proofs, the distinction between causal or ordinary explanations and genuine mathematical ones, and the unifying role of optimization explanations. More generally, the very idea that the explanatory advantages yielded by applied mathematical claims may be construed as gradual or progressive and the associated notion that the feasibility of their nominalistic paraphrases decreases as the generality and force of these claim increases, deserves a closer attention.','<b>Title: </b>Old evidence and new explanation III<br><b>Year: </b>2001<br><b>Author: </b> Cg.

These results imply the following. Suppose one wants to find out whether a phenomenon is best modeled as deterministic or indeterministic. Then one cannot appeal to differences in the probability distributions of deterministic and indeterministic descriptions found in science to argue that one of the descriptions is preferable because there is no such difference.

It starts by exploring the specificity of evolved physiological systems, in which evolutionary, developmental and proximal causes all fit together, and the concept of function is meaningful; in contrast, this structure does not apply in epidemiology or outside biology. Using these two contrasting branches of biology, I examine the role both of mechanism and of difference making in causation. I find that causation necessarily involves both mechanism and difference making, and that they play complementary roles. Both are seen as ontologically necessary, even if the evidence is not always available for both. Influential monist accounts that focus on one of these, at the expense of ignoring the other, are found to be inadequate on these and on other grounds. Recent attempts to combine them are reviewed, notably that of Russo and Williamson Int Stud Philos Sci 21:157-170, 2007, and it is argued that their epistemic view requires there to be a source of the different types of evidence that a rational agent would consider, and that this source must be ontic. I then analyze how causal relationships work in evolved physiological systems and in those studied by epidemiology, with a particular focus on how mechanism interacts with input. Finally, I consider this concept of causation from the perspective of everyday language, and of its possible generalisability outside biology.','<b>Title: </b>Much ado about nothing: A study of metaphysical nihilism<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> Rp.

But in general proof theory, in particular in categorial proof theory, one finds models of deductions, and the purpose here is to motivate a simple example of such models. This will be a model of deductions performed within an abstract context, where we do not have any particular logical constant, but something underlying all logical constants. In this context, deductions are represented by arrows in categories involved in a general adjoint situation. To motivate the notion of adjointness, one of the central notions of category theory, and of mathematics in general, it is first considered how some features of it occur in set-theoretical axioms and in the axioms of the lambda calculus. Next, it is explained how this notion arises in the context of deduction, where it characterizes logical constants. It is shown also how the categorial point of view suggests an analysis of propositional identity. The problem of propositional identity, i.e., the problem of identity of meaning for propositions, is no doubt a philosophical problem, but the spirit of the analysis proposed here will be rather mathematical. Finally, it is considered whether models of deductions can pretend to be a semantics. This question, which as so many questions having to do with meaning brings us to that wall that blocked linguists and philosophers during the whole of the twentieth century, is merely posed. At the very end, there is the example of a geometrical model of adjunction. Without pretending that it is a semantics, it is hoped that this model may prove illuminating and useful.','nan','<b>Title: </b>Bad company and neo-Fregean philosophy<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> M.

Kuipers<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>The qualitative theory of nomic truth approximation, presented in Kuipers in his from instrumentalism to constructive realism, 2000, in which the truth concerns the distinction between nomic, e.g. physical, possibilities and impossibilities, rests on a very restrictive assumption, viz. that theories always claim to characterize the boundary between nomic possibilities and impossibilities. Fully recognizing two different functions of theories, viz. excluding and representing, this paper drops this assumption by conceiving theories in development as tuples of postulates and models, where the postulates claim to exclude nomic impossibilities and the not-excluded models claim to represent nomic possibilities. Revising theories becomes then a matter of adding or revising models and/or postulates in the light of increasing evidence, captured by a special kind of theories, viz. data-theories. Under the assumption that the data-theory is true, achieving empirical progress in this way provides good reasons for the abductive conclusion that truth approximation has been achieved as well. Here, the notions of truth approximation and empirical progress are formally direct generalizations of the earlier ones. However, truth approximation is now explicitly defined in terms of increasing truth-content and decreasing falsity-content of theories, whereas empirical progress is defined in terms of lasting increased accepted and decreased rejected content in the light of increasing evidence. These definitions are strongly inspired by a paper of Gustavo Cevolani, Vincenzo Crupi and Roberto Festa, viz., Verisimilitude and belief change for conjunctive theories Cevolani et al. in Erkenntnis 752: 183-222, 2011.','<b>Title: </b>Is it possible to nominalize quantum mechanics<br><b>Year: </b>2003<br><b>Author: </b> O.

According to David Malament 1982, Fields strategy cannot be extended to quantum mechanics QM, and so it only has a limited scope. In a recent work, Mark Balaguer has responded to Malaments challenge by indicating how QM can be nominalized, and by doing much of the work needed to provide the nominalization Balaguer 1998, 114. In this paper, I critically assess Balaguers proposal, and argue that it ultimately fails. Balaguers strategy is incompatible with a number of interpretations of QM, in particular with Bas van Fraassens version of the modal interpretation. And given that Balaguers strategy invokes physically real propensities, it is unclear whether it is even compatible with nominalism. I conclude that the nominalization of QM remains a major problem for the nominalist.','<b>Title: </b>Missing systems and the face value practice<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> M.

Scientific textbooks, classroom lectures, and journal articles abound with such passages; and there is a widespread practice of talking and thinking as though there are systems which fit the descriptions they contain perfectly, despite the recognition that no actual, concrete systems do so-call this the face value practice. There are, furthermore, many instances in which philosophers engage in the face value practice whilst offering answers to epistemological and methodological questions about the sciences. Three questions, then: 1 How should we interpret descriptions of missing systems 2 How should we make sense of the face value practice 3 Is there a set of plausible answers to 1 and 2 which legitimates reliance on the face value practice in our philosophical work, and can support the weight of the accounts which are entangled with that practice In this paper I address these questions by considering three answers to the first: that descriptions of missing systems are straightforward descriptions of abstract objects, that they are indirect descriptions of property-containing abstracta, and that they are in a different way indirect descriptions of mathematical structures. All three proposals are present in the literature, but I find them wanting. The result is to highlight the importance of developing a satisfactory understanding of descriptions of missing systems and the face value practice, to put pressure on philosophical accounts which rely on the practice, and to help us assess the viability of certain approaches to thinking about models, theory structure, and scientific representation.','<b>Title: </b>A New Notion of Causal Closedness<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> L.

In this paper we introduce a new and natural notion similar to causal closedness and prove a number of theorems which can be seen as extensions of earlier results from the literature. Most notably we prove that a finite probability space is causally closed in our sense iff its measure is uniform. We also present a generalisation of this result to a class of non-classical probability spaces.','<b>Title: </b>MEASUREMENT AND THE INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM-MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY THEORY<br><b>Year: </b>1995<br><b>Author: </b> Wm.

We show that, contrary to Bartels claim, homomorphism fails to account for the phenomenon of misrepresentation. Bartels claims that homomorphism is adequate in two respects. First, it is conceptually adequate, in the sense that it shows how representation differs from misrepresentation and non-representation. Second, if properly weakened, homomorphism is formally adequate to accommodate misrepresentation. We question both claims. First, we show that homomorphism is not the right condition to distinguish representation from misrepresentation and non-representation: a representational mechanism actually does all the work, and it is independent of homomorphism - as of any structural condition. Second, we test the claim of formal adequacy against three typical kinds of inaccurate representation in science which, by reference to a discussion of the notorious billiard ball model, we define as abstraction, pretence, and simulation. We first point out that Bartels equivocates between homomorphism and the stronger condition of epimorphism, and that the weakened form of homomorphism that Bartels puts forward is not a morphism at all. After providing a formal setting for abstraction, pretence and simulation, we show that for each morphism there is at least one form of inaccurate representation which is not accommodated. We conclude that Bartels theory - while logically laying down the weakest structural requirements - is nonetheless formally inadequate in its own terms. This should shed serious doubts on the plausibility of any structural account of representation more generally.','<b>Title: </b>Representation at the nanoscale<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> O.

Recently, some philosophers of language have proposed theories of pragmatic compositionality challenging this assumption. This paper takes a close look at a prominent proposal of this kind due to Fran double dagger ois Recanati. The objective is to give a plausible formulation of the view. The major results are threefold. First, a basic distinction that contextualists make between mandatory and optional pragmatic processes needs to be revised. Second, the pragmatic theory can with stand a Davidsonian objection only by rejecting the importance of a distinction between primitive and non-primitive semantic items. Thirdly, however, the theory is now open to a worry about how it should be understood: either the theory consists in a very broad functionalist generalization about communication, which makes it explanatorily inert, or it boils down to a highly particularist view about linguistic meaning. Finally, I argue that Recanatis notion of occasion meaning is problematic and suggest replacing it with the notion of speaker meaning, which is explanatorily more basic.','<b>Title: </b>Confusion and dependence in uses of history<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> D.

This division has been attributed in part to a focus on different types of virtues, viz., faculty virtues and character virtues. I will argue that this distinction is unhelpful, and that we should carve up the theoretical terrain differently. Making several better distinctions among virtues will show us two important things. First, that responsibilists and reliabilists are actually engaged in different, complementary projects; and second, that certain responsibilist critiques of reliabilism miss the mark. With these distinctions on the table, we can see that the virtue reliabilist project is in some ways more fundamental than the responsibilist project, since the latter importantly depends on the former. I argue that the distinctively epistemic value of the responsibilists character virtues is derived from their connections to the reliabilists constitutive virtues. While this will give us a unified account of the epistemic value of intellectual virtues, it is not a reduction of the responsibilist project to the reliabilist one; rather, it as a way of securing the separate importance of each project by clarifying how they relate to one another.','<b>Title: </b>Godels philosophical program and Husserls phenomenology<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> Xl.

One of the topics that has attracted much attention recently is the development of Godels philosophical thoughts and its connection with other philosophical ideas. For instance, some scholars are searching for the possible connections between Godels philosophy and Husserls phenomenology and examining if there is any solid evidence of Husserls influence on Godel from Godels works Tieszen, Bull Symbolic Logic 42:181-203, 1998; Huaser, Bull Symbolic Logic 124:529-588, 2006.

So far there are no sufficient evidence to show that there is a direct inheritance relation between Godels and Husserls thoughts. However, from the clues in Godels idealistic philosophy, conceptual realism, and his concept of abstract intuition, we can perhaps explore some similarities between his thoughts and Husserls thoughts, and analyze the reason why Godel is interested in Husserls phenomenology and why his program for an exact philosophy is unfinished.','<b>Title: </b>Choices, consequences, and rationality<br><b>Year: </b>2001<br><b>Author: </b> W.

Although the core theory has been presented previously, I go significantly beyond those presentations by providing a new argument for GSE and defending it from a recent objection. I also sketch its implications for teleosemantics and philosophy of medicine.','<b>Title: </b>A fuzzy measure for explanatory coherence<br><b>Year: </b>2000<br><b>Author: </b> D.

The simplest such inference pattern is direct inference: from 70 of As are Bs and a is an A infer that a is a B with probability 0.7. Direct inference is generalized by Jeffreys rule and the principle of cross-entropy minimization. To adequately formalize inductive probabilistic reasoning is an interesting topic for artificial intelligence, as an autonomous system acting in a complex environment may have to base its actions on a probabilistic model of its environment, and the probabilities needed to form this model can often be obtained by combining statistical background information with particular observations made, i.e., by inductive probabilistic reasoning. In this paper a formal framework for inductive probabilistic reasoning is developed: syntactically it consists of an extension of the language of first-order predicate logic that allows to express statements about both statistical and subjective probabilities. Semantics for this representation language are developed that give rise to two distinct entailment relations: a relation satisfies that models strict, probabilistically valid, inferences, and a relation that models inductive probabilistic inferences. The inductive entailment relation is obtained by implementing cross-entropy minimization in a preferred model semantics. A main objective of our approach is to ensure that for both entailment relations complete proof systems exist. This is achieved by allowing probability distributions in our semantic models that use non-standard probability values. A number of results are presented that show that in several important aspects the resulting logic behaves just like a logic based on real-valued probabilities alone.','<b>Title: </b>The logic of indexicals<br><b>Year: </b>2015<br><b>Author: </b> A.

The central innovation is that validity depends not just on the sentences in the argument, but also on certain abstract relations between contexts. This enrichment of the notion of logical form leads to some seemingly counter-intuitive results: a sequence of sentences may make up a valid argument in one sequence of contexts, and an invalid one in another such sequence. I argue that this is an unavoidable result of context sensitivity in general, and of the nature of indexicals in particular, and that reflection on such examples will lead us to a better understanding of the idea of applying logic to context sensitive expressions, and thus to natural language in general.','<b>Title: </b>Epistemic Landscapes, Optimal Search, and the Division of Cognitive Labor<br><b>Year: </b>2015<br><b>Author: </b> Jm.

The broader context is given by the key question about the metaphysics of time: Is time tenseless, i.e., is time just a structure of instants; or is time tensed, because some facts are irreducibly tensed I take sides with Prior and the tensed theory. Like him, I therefore I have to deal with a more specific metaphysical question: How can the instants of tenseless time be reduced to tensed facts This is the point where, on the technical level, hybrid logic and metric logic come in. For present purposes, both can be seen as species of tense logic; and both are creations of Prior. In his argument for the tensed theory of time, Prior used hybrid tense logic to reduce instants. But, as he himself pointed out, this reduction runs into deep problems, because it immediately generalizes to other categories, for example and most importantly to persons. My main aim is to show that metric logic does not run into similar difficulties: It will help the tensed theory reduce instants, but it leaves persons untouched. I will also give reasons for preferring a metric to a hybrid logic of time that are independent of the metaphysical issue of reduction, but concern temporal reasoning, natural language semantics, and the epistemic side of time-keeping.','<b>Title: </b>On the quantitative scalar or-implicature<br><b>Year: </b>2005<br><b>Author: </b> L.

Specifically, they argue that if an agent maximizes conditional expected utility, then the agent will follow the causal decision theorists advice when she represents herself as intervening, and will follow the evidential decision theorists advice when she represents herself as not intervening. Since Meek and Glymour take no stand on whether agents should represent themselves as intervening, they provide more general advice than standard causal decision theorists and evidential decision theorists.

Wolfe<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>Intellectual history still quite commonly distinguishes between the episode we know as the Scientific Revolution, and its successor era, the Enlightenment, in terms of the calculatory and quantifying zeal of the former-the age of mechanics-and the rather scientifically lackadaisical mood of the latter, more concerned with freedom, public space and aesthetics. It is possible to challenge this distinction in a variety of ways, but the approach I examine here, in which the focus on an emerging scientific field or cluster of disciplines-the life sciences, particularly natural history, medicine, and physiology for biology does not make an appearance at least under this name or definition until the late 1790s-is, not Romantically anti-scientific, but resolutely anti-mathematical. Diderot bluntly states, in his Thoughts on the interpretation of nature 1753, that We are on the verge of a great revolution in the sciences. Given the taste people seem to have for morals, belles-lettres, the history of nature and experimental physics, I dare say that before a hundred years, there will not be more than three great geometricians remaining in Europe. The science will stop short where the Bernoullis, the Eulers, the Maupertuis, the Clairauts, the Fontaines and the DAlemberts will have left it.... We will not go beyond. Similarly, Buffon in the first discourse of his Histoire naturelle 1749 speaks of the over-reliance on mathematical sciences, given that mathematical truths are merely definitional and demonstrative, and thereby abstract, intellectual and arbitrary. Earlier in the Thoughts, Diderot judges the thing of the mathematician to have as little existence in nature as that of the gambler. Significantly, this attitude-taken by great scientists who also translated Newton Buffon or wrote careful papers on probability theory Diderot, as well as by others such as Mandeville-participates in the effort to conceptualize what we might call a new ontology for the emerging life sciences, very different from both the iatromechanism and the animism of earlier generations, which either failed to account for specifically living, goal-directed features of organisms, or accounted for them in supernaturalistic terms by appealing to an anima as explanatory principle. Anti-mathematicism here is then a key component of a naturalistic, open-ended project to give a successful reductionist model of explanation in natural history one is tempted to say biology, a model which is no more vitalist than it is materialist-but which is fairly far removed from early modern mechanism.','<b>Title: </b>Action and knowledge in alternating-time temporal logic<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> T.

Alternating-time temporal epistemic logic ATEL extends ATL by adding knowledge modalities, with the usual possible worlds interpretation. This paper investigates how properties of agents actions can be expressed in ATL in general, and how properties of the interaction between action and knowledge can be expressed in ATEL in particular. One commonly discussed property is that an agent should know about all available actions, i.e., that the same actions should be available in indiscernible states. Van der Hoek and Wooldridge suggest a syntactic expression of this semantic property. This paper shows that this correspondence in fact does not hold. Furthermore, it is shown that the semantic property is not expressible in ATEL at all. In order to be able to express common and interesting properties of action in general and of the interaction between action and knowledge in particular, a generalization of the coalition modalities of ATL is proposed. The resulting logics, ATL-A and ATEL-A, have increased expressiveness without loosing ATLs and ATELs tractability of model checking.','<b>Title: </b>Explanations of exceptions in biology: corrective asymmetry versus autonomy<br><b>Year: </b>2017<br><b>Author: </b> J.

This special status of biology is used as a premise in arguments that posit a deprived explanatory, nomological, or methodological status in the biological sciences. I will discuss the traditional and still almost universally held idea that the biological sciences cannot deal with exceptions and application conditions of their generalizations with their own distinctive and proprietary explanantia, but need the help of lower-level sciences to carry out this task. The idea of lower-level explanations of exceptions is connected to the idea that the biological sciences need lower-level sciences to better themselves and to the idea that biological sciences cannot provide reliable and extrapolatable results or explanations by themselves. I present counterexamples to the idea of lower-level explanations of exceptions in biology. I also discuss and refute more general arguments why the idea of lower-level explanations of exceptions has been held to hold in the special sciences, such as the screening-off and openness arguments. This suggest that there might be nothing special about the biological sciences vis-A -vis the more fundamental natural sciences, such as physics insofar as explanations of exceptions are concerned, and that the biological sciences can provide reliable and extrapolatable results or explanations by themselves.','<b>Title: </b>Two models of unawareness: comparing the object-based and the subjective-state-space approaches<br><b>Year: </b>2011<br><b>Author: </b> Oj.

Clarke<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>Some explanations in social science, psychology and biology belong to a higher level than other explanations. And higher explanations possess the virtue of abstracting away from the details of lower explanations, many philosophers argue. As a result, these higher explanations are irreplaceable. And this suggests that there are genuine higher laws or patterns involving social, psychological and biological states. I show that this abstractness argument is really an argument schema, not a single argument. This is because the argument uses the is lower than relation, and this relation admits of different readings. I then suggest four rigorous definitions of the is lower than relation, and show that the abstractness arguments prospects are much brighter for some of these definitions than for others. To show this, I evaluate the so-called disjunctive threat to the abstractness argument.Some explanations belong to a higher level than others. To a very rough approximation, psychological explanations are typically higher than physiological ones, for example; but psychological explanations are typically lower than social ones. And so, for any explanation that correctly explains why a phenomenon occurred, one can ask: is there some lower explanation that also correctly explains the phenomenon And, if there is, can this lower explanation replace the higher explanation And by replace I mean: the higher explanation provides no understanding of why the phenomenon occurred over and above the understanding of it that the lower explanation provides.In practice, philosophers agree that the answer is often that the higher explanation in question cant be replaced. Suppose-just to explore how absurd the idea is-that every correct higher explanation could indeed be replaced by some correct lower explanation. This would in many cases require that the lower explanation describe monstrously complicated lower facts. Instead of describing a nation as being atwar, for example, it would need to describe the actions performed by each of several thousand soldiers, civilians and politicians. But human inquirers are not able to entertain such monstrously complicated propositions, let alone communicate such propositions to others. Thus some higher explanations are irreplaceable-at least in practice for human inquirers.Much more controversial, however, is the question of whether some higher explanations are irreplaceable even in principle. 1 On the face of it, this question seems to be a question about an idealizer inquirer, one who can entertain more complicated propositions. The question asks: do any higher explanations provide this idealized inquirer with understanding above and beyond that provided by every lower explanation Unfortunately, this question doesnt specify the extent to which one is supposed, when tackling this question, to idealize away from our cognitive imperfections as humans. Exactly what propositions is an idealized inquirer supposed to be able to entertain As a result, there is a risk that the controversy over in-principle replaceability will boil down to an insubstantial dispute over the definition of an idealized inquirer.This paper will clearly identify the substantial issues at stake in this controversy, and will separate them from insubstantial disputes over definitions. Specifically, it will clarify the logic of an argument at the centre of the controversy, which I will call the abstractness argument; and it will clarify the logic of the so-called  disjunctive threat to this abstractness argument. For one thing, I will show that the abstractness argument appeals to an  is lower than relation that admits multiple definitions. This is important because it is easier to neutralize the disjunctive threat to the abstractness argument for some definitions of the  is lower than relation than for others, Iwill show. For example, I will show that the abstractness arguments run by several philosophers fail-namely those run by Block, Fodor, Kincaid, Kornblith, Levine, Marras, Pereboom, Putnam, Weslake and at one stage Antony. I hope that the clarificatory work of this paper will allow me to press this criticism more clearly and forcefully than existing criticisms in the literature.','<b>Title: </b>Object exploration and a problem with reductionism<br><b>Year: </b>2005<br><b>Author: </b> A.

In that framework there is room for funny business, i.e., modal correlations such as occur through quantum-mechanical entanglement. This paper extends previous work by Belnap on notions of funny business. We provide two generalized definitions of funny business. Combinatorial funny business can be characterized as absence of prima facie consistent scenarios, while explanatory funny business characterizes situations in which no localized explanation of inconsistency can be given. These two definitions of funny business are proved to be equivalent, and we provide an example that shows them to be strictly more general than the previously available definitions of funny business.','<b>Title: </b>Do the laws of physics forbid the operation of time machines<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> J.

This question has received a great deal of attention in the physics literature, with attempts to prove no-go theorems based on classical general relativity and various hybrid theories serving as steps along the way towards quantum gravity. Despite the effort put into these no-go theorems, there is no widely accepted definition of a time machine. We explain the conundrum that must be faced in providing a satisfactory definition and propose a resolution. Roughly, we require that all extensions of the time machine region contain closed timelike curves; the actions of the time machine operator are then sufficiently potent to guarantee that closed timelike curves appear. We then review no-go theorems based on classical general relativity, semi-classical quantum gravity, quantum field theory on curved spacetime, and Euclidean quantum gravity. Our verdict on the question of our title is that no result of sufficient generality to underwrite a confident yes has been proven. Our review of the no-go results does, however, highlight several foundational problems at the intersection of general relativity and quantum physics that lend substance to the search for an answer.','<b>Title: </b>Old evidence and new explanation II<br><b>Year: </b>1999<br><b>Author: </b> Cg.

He intends not merely to explain what similarity consists in, but also to capture similarity judgments made by scientists. In order to scrutinize whether his account fulfills this goal, I outline one common way in which scientists judge whether a model is similar enough to its target, namely maximum likelihood estimation method MLE. Then I consider whether Weisbergs account could capture the judgments involved in this practice. I argue that his account fails for three reasons. First, his account is simply too abstract to capture what is going on in MLE. Second, it implies an atomistic conception of similarity, while MLE operates in a holistic manner. Third, Weisbergs atomistic conception of similarity can be traced back to a problematic set-theoretic approach to the structure of models. Finally, I tentatively suggest how these problems might be solved by a holistic approach in which models and targets are compared in a non-set-theoretic fashion.','<b>Title: </b>The Structure of the Strategy: Looking at the Matthewson-Weisberg Trade-off and Its Justificatory Role for the Multiple-Models Approach<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> M.

The generality problem is the problem of specifying the level of generality at which a belief-forming process is to be described for the purpose of assessing its reliability. This problem is not as intractable as it seems. There are illuminating solutions to analogous problems in the ethics literature. Reliabilists ought to attend to utilitarian approaches to choices between infinite utility streams; they also ought to attend to welfarist approaches to social choice situations that do not demand full aggregation of individual welfares. These analogies suggest that the traditional single number approach to reliability is misguided. I argue that a new approach - the vector reliability approach - is preferable. Vector reliability theories associate target beliefs with reliability vectors - that is, structured collections of reliability numbers - and construct criteria of epistemic justification that appeal to these vectors. The bulk of the theoretical labor involved in a reliability account of epistemic justification is thus transferred from picking a unique reliability number to constructing a plausible criterion of epistemic justification.','<b>Title: </b>Counterfactuals and spatiotemporal events<br><b>Year: </b>2004<br><b>Author: </b> T.

Yet there are arguments that when we take into account relativistic features of space-time, this relation should be only a partial ordering. The first part of the paper deals with the question of how to formulate appropriate truth conditions for counterfactuals under the supposition of a partial ordering of possible worlds. Such truth conditions will be put forward, and it will be argued that they are more general than those proposed in recent literature, because they turn out to be applicable also when the so-called Limit Assumption is not met. The second part analyzes two relativistically invariant ways of interpreting spatiotemporal counterfactuals with antecedents referring to free-chance point events. After briefly examining key differences between these two approaches, the issue of their extension for a broader class of antecedents will be addressed. Following the approach of Finkelstein  1999, who has proposed a specifically designed similarity relation between possible worlds, serving as a generalization tool in the case of one of the above intuitions, the possibility of a similar extension for the second interpretation will be considered. The main result of the paper is the theorem to the effect that the generalization of the second intuition is impossible to obtain. More specifically, the theorem proved in the paper states that there is no similarity relation which together with the Lewis-style truth conditions for counterfactuals would imply the second of the above interpretations as a special case. Some consequences of this theorem for the applicability of the Lewis logic of counterfactuals to quantum phenomena will be briefly mentioned at the end of the paper.','<b>Title: </b>Iterated Belief Revision<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> R.

Together they show that if the probabilities given by quantum mechanics are approximately correct, then the properties exhibited by certain physical systems must be nontrivially dependent on the types of measurements performed and either nonlocally connected or holistically related to distant events.  Although a number of related arguments have appeared since John Bells original paper 1964, they tend to be either highly technical or to lack full generality.  The following arguments depend on the weakest of premises, and the structure of the arguments is simpler than most without any loss of rigor or generality.  The technical simplicity is due in part to a novel version of the generalized Bell inequality.  The arguments are self contained and presuppose no knowledge of quantum mechanics.  We will also offer a Dutch Book argument for measurement type dependence.','<b>Title: </b>Can there be a Bayesian explanationism On the prospects of a productive partnership<br><b>Year: </b>2017<br><b>Author: </b> F.

In Sect. 2, I give a brief overview of Bayesianism and IBE. In Sect. 3, I argue that IBE in its most prominently defended forms is difficult to reconcile with Bayesianism because not all of the items that feature on popular lists of explanatory virtues-by means of which IBE ranks competing explanations-have confirmational import. Rather, some of the items that feature on these lists are informational virtues-properties that do not make a hypothesis more probable than some competitor given evidence E, but that, roughly-speaking, give that hypothesis greater informative content. In Sect. 4, I consider as a response to my argument a recent version of compatibilism which argues that IBE can provide further normative constraints on the objectively correct probability function. I argue that this response does not succeed, owing to the difficulty of defending with any generality such further normative constraints. Lastly, in Sect. 5, I propose that IBE should be regarded, not as a theory of scientific inference, but rather as a theory of when we ought to accept H, where the acceptability of H is fixed by the goals of science and concerns whether H is worthy of commitment as research program. In this way, IBE and Bayesianism, as I will show, can be made compatible, and thus the Bayesian and the proponent of IBE can be friends.','<b>Title: </b>Minimalism and the generalisation problem: on Horwichs second solution<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> C.

The aim will be to explain why someone who accepts a given disquotational truth theory Th, should also accept various generalisations not provable in Th.

Both theories play a fundamental role in describing the same natural world, although at different scales. However, the inconsistency between them emerged clearly as the limitation of twentieth-century physics, so a more complete description of nature must encompass general relativity and quantum mechanics as well. The problem is a theorists problem par excellence. Experiment provide little guide, and the inconsistency mentioned above is an important problem which clearly illustrates the intermingling of philosophical, mathematical, and physical thought. In fact, in order to unify general relativity with quantum field theory, it seems necessary to invent a new mathematical framework which will generalise Riemannian geometry and therefore our present conception of space and space-time. Contemporary developments in theoretical physics suggest that another revolution may be in progress, through which a new kind of geometry may enter physics, and space-time itself can be reinterpreted as an approximate, derived concept. The main purpose of this article is to show the great significance of space-time geometry in predetermining the laws which are supposed to govern the behaviour of matter, and further to support the thesis that matter itself can be built from geometry, in the sense that particles of matter as well as the other forces of nature emerges in the same way that gravity emerges from geometry.','<b>Title: </b>Ecological kinds and ecological laws<br><b>Year: </b>2003<br><b>Author: </b> Gm.

Yet, by recognizing that the failure to explain the truth of disparate propositions often stems from inflationary approaches allegiance to alethic monism, pluralist approaches are able to avoid this-explanatory inadequacy and the resulting skepticism, though at the cost of inviting other conceptual difficulties. A novel approach, alethic functionalism, attempts to circumvent the problems faced by pluralist approaches while preserving their main insights.

A central feature of this liberalization was the deployment of the Principle of Tolerance, originally introduced in logic, but now invoked in an epistemological context in Testability and Meaning Carnap 1936a, 1937b. Immediately afterwards, starting with Foundations of Logic and Mathematics, Carnap 1939 embraced semantics and turned to interpretation to guide the choice of a theoretical language for science. The first thesis of this paper is that recourse to an intended interpretation led to a partial retrenchment of the conventionalism implied by the Principle of Tolerance. It required that the choice of a language be based on abstraction from a typically empirical context; this procedure later became a component of the process of explication that was distinctive to Carnaps mature views. The typically empirical interpretive origin of formal systems also ensured their likely syntactic consistency, an issue on which Carnap was strongly criticized by figures such as Beth and Godel. The second thesis of this paper is that this reliance on an intended interpretation enabled constructed formal systems to be relevant to the development of empirical science.','<b>Title: </b>Aggregating with reasons<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> F.

As is often the case in science, generalizing theoretically simplified notions is not straightforward because of issues hidden in the special case. These issues do not, however, tum out to be essentially conventional.','<b>Title: </b>Dutch Books and nonclassical probability spaces<br><b>Year: </b>2017<br><b>Author: </b> L. Wronski and  Mt.

Noting that the particular notion of a nonclassical probability space used by Feintzeig is not the most common employed in philosophy of physics, and that his usage of the classical Dutch Book concept is not appropriate in nonclassical contexts, we then argue that if we switch to the more frequently used formalism and use the correct notion of a Dutch Book, then all probability spaces are not susceptible to a Dutch Book. We also settle a hypothesis regarding the existence of classical extensions of a class of generalized probability spaces.','<b>Title: </b>General theories of explanation: buyer beware<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> J.

Using Nickel NoA >> s 442:305-328, 2010 as an exemplar of the contrary, generalist position, we first show that Nickels arguments rest on several ambiguities, and then show that even when these ambiguities are charitably corrected, Nickels defense of general theories of explanation is inadequate along several different dimensions. Specifically, we argue that Nickels argument has three fatal flaws. First, he has not provided any compelling illustrations of domain-invariant constraints on explanation. Second, in order to fend off the most vehement skeptics of domain-invariant theories of explanation, Nickel must beg all of the important questions. Third, Nickels examples of explanations from different domains with common explanatory structure rely on incorrect formulations of the explanations under consideration, circular justifications, and/or a mischaracterization of the position Nickel intends to critique. Given that the best and most elaborate defense of the generalist position fails in so many ways, we conclude that the standard practice in philosophy and in philosophy of science in particular, which is to develop theories of explanation that are tailored to specific domains, still is justified. For those who want to buy into a more ambitious project: beware of the costs.','<b>Title: </b>Qualitative scientific modeling and loop analysis<br><b>Year: </b>2005<br><b>Author: </b> J.

Thus there is a choice between a deterministic and an indeterministic model and the question arises: Which model is preferable relative to evidence If the evidence equally supports both models, there is underdetermination. This paper first distinguishes between different kinds of choice and clarifies the possible resulting types of underdetermination. Then a new answer is presented: the focus is on the choice between a Newtonian deterministic model supported by indirect evidence from other Newtonian models which invoke similar additional assumptions about the physical systems and a stochastic model that is not supported by indirect evidence. It is argued that the deterministic model is preferable. The argument against underdetermination is then generalised to a broader class of cases. Finally, the paper criticises the extant philosophical answers in relation to the preferable model. Winnies 1998 argument for the deterministic model is shown to deliver the correct conclusion relative to observations which are possible in principle and where there are no limits, in principle, on observational accuracy the type of choice Winnie was concerned with. However, in practice the argument fails. A further point made is that Hoefers 2008 argument for the deterministic model is untenable.','<b>Title: </b>Observer-relative chances in anthropic reasoning<br><b>Year: </b>2000<br><b>Author: </b> N.

Maki<br><b>Journal: </b>ERKENNTNIS<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>In order to examine the fit between realism and science, one needs to address two issues: the unit of science question realism about which parts of science and the contents of realism question which realism about science. Answering these questions is a matter of conceptual and empirical inquiry by way local case studies. Instead of the more ordinary abstract and global scientific realism, what we get is a doubly local scientific realism based on a bottom-up strategy. Representative formulations of the former kind are in terms of the truth and reality of the posits of current science, in terms of warranted belief, in terms of mind-independent unobservable entities. Using illustrations mainly from the social sciences, doubly local scientific realism denies the global applicability of such formulations and seeks to make adjustments in their elements in response to information about local units of science: It is sufficient for a realist to give the existence of an entity and the truth of a theory a chance, while in some areas we may be in s position to make justified claims about actual existence and truth. Logical inquiry-independent existence is sufficient for the social and human sciences, while mind-independence will be fine for many other domains. It should not be insisted that the theoretical posits of realist science be strict unobservables in all areas: most theoretical posits of the social sciences are idealized commonsensibles, such as elements in folk psychology. Unsurprisingly, this sort of local strategy will create space for realism that is able to accommodate larger areas of science without sacrificing traditional realist intuitions.','nan','<b>Title: </b>Complex systems, trade-offs, and theoretical population biology: Richard Levins strategy of model building in population biology revisited<br><b>Year: </b>2003<br><b>Author: </b> J.

Meanwhile, several authors have argued that causal decision theory should be developed such that it integrates the interventionist approach to causal modeling because of the expressive power afforded by the language of causal models, but, as of now, there has been little work towards this end. In this paper, I propose a variant of Lewiss causal decision theory that is intended to meet both of these demands. Specifically, I argue that Lewiss causal decision theory can be rendered applicable to small world decisions if one analyzes his dependency hypotheses as causal hypotheses that depend on the interventionist causal modeling framework for their semantics. I then argue that this interventionist variant of Lewiss causal decision theory is preferable to interventionist causal decision theories that purportedly generalize Lewiss through the use of conditional probabilities. This is because Lewisian interventionist decision theory captures the causal decision theorists conviction that any correlation between what the agent does and cannot cause should be irrelevant to the agents choice, while purported generalizations do not.','<b>Title: </b>On the proof-theoretic foundation of general definition theory<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> L.

Parsons argues for a version of structuralism which is restricted by the condition that some paradigmatic structure should be presented that makes clear the actual existence of structures of the necessary sort. Parsons paradigmatic structure is the so-called intuitive model of arithmetic realized by Hilberts strings of strokes. This paper argues that Hilberts strings, considered as given in intuition, cannot play the role Parsons assigns to them: the criteria of identity of these strings do not have the sharpness that Parsons wants to see in them, and Parsons inadvertently projects abstract structures into his intuitive model. This diagnosis is exemplified with respect to a Parsons distinction between addition and multiplication on the one hand and exponentiation on the other and b his analysis of arithmetical knowledge in simple cases like 7  5  12. All in all, it is claimed that Parsons book contains many important insights with respect to, for example, different versions structuralism, the notion of natural number and its uniqueness, induction, predicativity and other things, for which he is rightly famous, but that his way of drawing on the notion of intuition leaves too many questions unanswered.','<b>Title: </b>Wittgenstein and finitism<br><b>Year: </b>1995<br><b>Author: </b> M.

In the last section, there is a brief discussion of Wittgensteins remarks on real numbers.

They are believed to be the semantic values of sentences in contexts, the objects of attitudes, the contents of illocutionary acts, the referents of that-clauses, and the primary bearers of truth. This assumption is often combined with the claim that propositions have their truth-values eternally. Following Kaplans and Lewiss Operator Argument, I argue that the compositional semantic values of sentences do not correspond to eternal propositions. Therefore, we cannot hold on to both assumptions at the same time: either we regard the non-eternal entities that realize the compositional role of propositions as fulfilling the remaining theoretical roles, or we abandon the assumption that there is a unique realizer. The Operator Argument has recently come under attack, mainly for its intensional assumptions. However, rejecting these assumptions is not a sufficient defense of eternal propositions as compositional semantic values of sentences. Firstly, we can give a generalized version of the Operator Argument that seems independent of the contested assumptions. Secondly, the extensional alternative to the intensional framework does not allow us to retain eternal propositions as unique semantic values either.','<b>Title: </b>A Generalized Manifold Topology for Branching Space-Times<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> T.

We investigate what happens if a RT is retained while Preservation is weakened, or b vice versa.  We also generalize Gardenfors approach by treating belief revision as a relation rather than as a function.In our semantic approach, the same relation is used to model belief revision and to give truth-conditions for conditionals.  The approach validates a weak version of the Ramsey Test WRR - essentially, a restriction of RT to maximally consistent belief states.We prove that alternatives a and b are both consistent, but argue that b is philosophically more promising.  Gardenfors belief-revision axioms are compatible with WRR together with RT from left to right:  the only direction of the test that is defensible on intuitive grounds.','<b>Title: </b>Natures drawing: problems and resolutions in the mathematization of motion<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> O.

The mathematization of nature Koyr, 1957, From the closed world to the infinite universe, 5 is commonly hailed as the great achievement of the scientific revolution, but for the agents affecting this development it was not a clear insight into the structure of the universe or into the proper way of studying it. Rather, it was a deliberate project of great intellectual promise, but fraught with excruciating technical challenges and unsettling epistemological conundrums. These required a radical change in the relations between mathematics, order and physical phenomena and the development of new practices of tracing and analyzing motion. This essay presents a series of discrete moments in this process. For mediaeval and Renaissance philosophers, mathematicians and painters, physical motion was the paradigm of change, hence of disorder, and ipso facto available to mathematical analysis only as idealized abstraction. Kepler and Galileo boldly reverted the traditional presumptions: for them, mathematical harmonies were embedded in creation; motion was the carrier of order; and the objects of mathematics were mathematical curves drawn by nature itself. Mathematics could thus be assigned an explanatory role in natural philosophy, capturing a new metaphysical entity: pure motion. Successive generations of natural philosophers from Descartes to Huygens and Hooke gradually relegated the need to legitimize the application of mathematics to natural phenomena and the blurring of natural and artificial this application relied on. Newton finally erased the distinction between natures and artificial mathematics altogether, equating all of geometry with mechanical practice.','<b>Title: </b>A defence of informational structural realism<br><b>Year: </b>2008<br><b>Author: </b> L.

First, it is shown that, within the debate about structural realism SR, epistemic ESR and ontic OSR structural realism are reconcilable. It follows that a version of OSR is defensible from a structuralist-friendly position. Second, it is argued that a version of OSR is also plausible, because not all relata structured entities are logically prior to relations structures. Third, it is shown that a version of OSR is also applicable to both sub-observable unobservable and instrumentally-only observable and observable entities, by developing its ontology of structural objects in terms of informational objects. The outcome is informational structural realism, a version of OSR supporting the ontological commitment to a view of the world as the totality of informational objects dynamically interacting with each other. The paper has been discussed by several colleagues and, in the second half, ten objections that have been moved to the proposal are answered in order to clarify it further.','<b>Title: </b>Which witch is which Exotic objects and intentional identity<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Book<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>Representationalism in cognitive science holds that semantic meaning should be explained by representations in the mind or brain. In this paper it is argued that semantic meaning should instead be explained by an abstract theory of semantic machines - machines with predicative capability. The concept of a semantic machine like that of a Turing machine or of Dennetts intentional systems is not a physical concept - although it has physical implementations. The predicative competence of semantic machines is defined in terms of independent agreement alone cf. independent, and yet synchronised, clocks. Abstract theories are analysed as systems of quasi-apriori rules for abstract predicates. A relatively limited number of such theories and a few fundamental dimensions space, time, mass, etc. are today assumed to exhaust physical reality. However, that assumption need not be in conflict with predicates that cannot be defined in physical terms - for instance the functional and intentional terms that are crucial for cognitive science.','<b>Title: </b>Experimental localism and external validity<br><b>Year: </b>2003<br><b>Author: </b> F.

Almost 20 years later Holder 1889 was able to extend this result by showing that the factor groups, which are quotient groups corresponding to the composition factors, are isomorphic. This result, nowadays called the Jordan-Holder Theorem, is one of the fundamental theorems in the theory of groups. The fact that Jordan, who was working in the framework of substitution groups, was able to prove only a part of this theorem is often used to emphasize the importance and even the necessity of the abstract conception of groups, which was employed by Holder. However, as a little-known paper from 1873 reveals, Jordan had all the necessary ingredients to prove the Jordan-Holder Theorem at his disposal namely, composition series, quotient groups, and isomorphisms, and he also noted a connection between composition factors and corresponding quotient groups. Thus, I argue that the answer to the question posed in the title is Yes. It was not the lack of the abstract notion of groups which prevented Jordan from proving the Jordan-Holder Theorem, but the fact that he did not ask the right research question that would have led him to this result. In addition, I suggest some reasons why this has been overlooked in the historiography of algebra, and I argue that, by hiding computational and cognitive complexities, abstraction has important pragmatic advantages.','<b>Title: </b>Interdiscourse or supervenience relations: The primacy of the manifest image<br><b>Year: </b>1996<br><b>Author: </b> J.

In this paper I critically review the most recent proposals to specify the nature of interdiscourse relations, focusing on the concept of supervenience. Ideally supervenience is a relation between different discourses which has all the advantages of reduction, but without its disadvantages. I apply the more abstract considerations to two concrete cases: schizophrenia and colour. Usually an interlevel or interdiscourse relation is seen as asymmetrical: the overlaying discourse depends on the underlying discourse and not vice versa, where the out- or un-spoken assumption is that the ultimate underlying discourse is physical. Instead I argue that scientific categories referred to in interdiscourse relations are, ultimately, dependent on common sense categories and common sense normative criteria. It is the manifest categories and common sense ideas about what is reasonable and what is right that determine the relevant categorisations at the deeper, underlying levels. I suggest that the implications of this are not merely methodological or epistemological.','<b>Title: </b>How we divide the world<br><b>Year: </b>2000<br><b>Author: </b> M.

Thus, gold but not jewelry is a real kind. However, by such a criterion, few if any kinds or systems of classification employed in the social science are real, for the social sciences offer, at best, only restricted generalizations. Thus, according to conventional wisdom, race and class are on a par with telephone area codes and postal zones; all are nominal rather than real. I propose an account of real kinds that recognizes the current reality of race but not zip codes and shows how a kind can be both constructed and real. One virtue of such an understanding of realism is the light shed on our current practice of racial classification. Race is not a real biological kind but neither is race a myth or illusion. However, the question of whether a social kind is real is separate from whether the category is legitimate. W. E. B. Du Bois maintained that while there are no biological races, race is real and should be conserved. My aim, in this paper, is not to argue for the legitimacy or conservation of race but to defend Du Boiss idea that kinds of people can be both made up and real and provide an understanding of realism that does justice to the social sciences.','<b>Title: </b>Making mechanism interesting<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Philos Sci 67:1-25, 2000, the mechanists have qualify their methodological dicta, and limit the vulnerability of their claims by strategic vagueness regarding their application. I go on to generalize a version of the mechanist requirement on explanations due to Craver and Kaplan Philos Sci 784:601-627, 2011 in cognitive and systems neuroscience so that it applies broadly across the life sciences in accordance with the view elaborated by Craver and Darden in In Search of Mechanisms 2013. I then go on to explore what ramifications their mechanist requirement on explanations may have for explanatory dependencies reported in biology and the special sciences. What this exploration suggests is that mechanism threatens to eliminate instead of underwrite a large number of such dependencies reported in higher-levels of biology and the special sciences. I diagnose the source of this threat in mechanisms demand that explanations identify nested causal differences makers in mechanisms, their components, the components further components, and so forth. Finally, I identify the love-hate relationship mechanism must have with functional explanation, and show how it makes mechanism an extremely interesting thesis indeed.','<b>Title: </b>Theories of Abstract Objects without Ad Hoc Restriction<br><b>Year: </b>2011<br><b>Author: </b> Wf.

The major challenge for foundation-oriented justifications consists in the problem of stopping the justificational regress without taking recourse to dogmatic assumptions or circular reasoning. Two alternative accounts that attempt to circumvent this problem, coherentism and externalism, are critically discussed and rejected as unsatisfactory. It is argued that optimality arguments are a new type of foundation-oriented justification that can stop the justificational regress. This is demonstrated on the basis of a novel result in the area of induction: the optimality of meta-induction. In the final section the method of optimality justification is generalized to deductive and abductive inferences.','<b>Title: </b>Constructive geometrical reasoning and diagrams<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> J.

Specifically, we focus on research into abstract design principles that underpin the functional organization of extant organisms. Drawing on case studies from engineering-inspired approaches in biology we show how optimality analysis, and other design-related methods, play a specific methodological role that is tangential to the study of adaptation. To account for the role of these reasoning strategies in contemporary biology, we therefore suggest a reevaluation of the connection between design thinking and adaptationism.','<b>Title: </b>Between the fundamental and the phenomenological: The challenge of semi-empirical methods<br><b>Year: </b>1997<br><b>Author: </b> Jl.

This is not a purely deductive or inductive process, nor does it involve causes and capacities in any simple way Humphreys 1995. I argue the predictive successes of such methods require us to reanalyze our views about the nature of prediction, the status of models, and the goals of science.

By highlighting the continuities dimensional analysis has with forms of modelling we are able to describe more precisely what makes dimensional analysis explanatory and understand otherwise puzzling aspects of dimensional reasoning, such as introducing fictitious dimensions and excluding dimensionally relevant information to characterise some systems. Finally, thinking of dimensional arguments as a form of modelling allows an explication of the role abstraction and multiple realisability; not as compatibility with other possible worlds but as compatibility with different fictional descriptions of our own world.','<b>Title: </b>The No-Miracles Argument, reliabilism, and a methodological version of the generality problem<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> M.

We can formulate this argument as an inference to the best explanation IBE, but doing so leads to the worry that it is viciously circular. Realists have responded to this accusation of circularity by appealing to reliabilism, an externalist epistemology. In this paper I argue that this retreat fails. Reliabilism suffers from a potentially devastating difficulty known as the Generality Problem and attempts to solve this problem require adopting both epistemic and metaphysical assumptions regarding local scientific theories. Although the externalist can happily adopt the former, if he adopts the latter then the Generality Problem arises again, but now at the level of scientific methodology. Answering this new version of the Generality Problem is impossible for the scientific realist without making the important further assumption that there exists the possibility of a unique rule of IBE. Doing this however would make the NMA viciously premise circular.','<b>Title: </b>On the notions of indiscernibility and indeterminacy in the light of the Galois-Grothendieck theory<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> G.

Grothendiecks reformulation of Galois theory permits to recast the Galois correspondence between symmetry groups and invariants as a Galois-Grothendieck duality between -spaces and the minimal observable algebras that discern or separate their points. According to the natural epistemic interpretation of the original Galois theory, the possible -indiscernibilities between the roots of a polynomial result from the limitations of the field . We discuss the relation between this epistemic interpretation of the Galois-Grothendieck duality and Leibnizs principle of the identity of indiscernibles. We then use the conceptual framework provided by Kleins Erlangen program to propose an alternative ontologic interpretation of this duality. The Galoisian symmetries are now interpreted in terms of the automorphisms of the symmetric geometric figures that can be placed in a background Klein geometry. According to this interpretation, the Galois-Grothendieck duality encodes the compatibility condition between geometric figures endowed with groups of automorphisms and the observables that can be consistently evaluated at such figures. In this conceptual framework, the Galoisian symmetries do not encode the epistemic indiscernibility between individuals, but rather the intrinsic indeterminacy in the pointwise localization of the figures with respect to the background Klein geometry.','<b>Title: </b>Another Approach to Consensus and Maximally Informed Opinions with Increasing Evidence<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> Rt.

After arguing that none of the above fully succeed, we consider the conspiracy problem through the lens of our preferred view of laws, an elaboration of the MRL view that we call the Better Best System BBS theory. BBS offers a picture on which, although all events supervene on a fundamental level, there is no one unique locus of projectibility; rather there are a large number of loci corresponding to the different areas ecology, economics, solid-state chemistry, etc. in which there are simple and strong generalizations to be made. While we expect that some amount of conspiracy-fear-inducing special science projectibility is inevitable given BBS, well argue that this is unobjectionable. It follows from BBS that the laws of any particular special or fundamental science amount to a proper subset of the laws. From this vantage point, the existence of projectible special science generalizations not guaranteed by the fundamental laws is not an occasion for conspiracy fantasies, but a predictable fact of life in a complex world.','<b>Title: </b>Generalized Conditionalization and the Sleeping Beauty Problem<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> T.

These include providing a theory of information underlying classical and quantum information; generalising the theory of computation to include all physical transformations; unifying formal statements of conservation laws with the stronger operational ones such as the ruling-out of perpetual motion machines; expressing the principles of testability and of the computability of nature currently deemed methodological and metaphysical respectively as laws of physics; allowing exact statements of emergent laws such as the second law of thermodynamics; and expressing certain apparently anthropocentric attributes such as knowledge in physical terms.','<b>Title: </b>Emergence and interacting hierarchies in shock physics<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> M. Pexton<br><b>Journal: </b>EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>It is argued that explanations of shock waves display explanatory emergence in two different ways. Firstly, the use of discontinuities to model jumps in flow variables is an example of physics avoidance. This is where microphysical details can be ignored in an abstract model thus allowing us access to modal information which cannot be attained in principle in any other way. Secondly, Whithams interleaving criterion for continuous shock structure is an example of the way different characteristic scales interact in shock dynamics. To fully explain the shock structure one must take account of these different scales, and by doing so explanations of shock structure have irreducible aspects. Lastly, the implications of this explanatory irreducibility are examined in the context of explanatory indispensability arguments used in realism debates elsewhere in the philosophy of science. It is concluded that explanatory emergence on its own only supports an epistemic form of emergence. Yet this epistemic emergence is fully objective.','<b>Title: </b>An Ontology of Words<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> N.

Unfortunately, the logical interpretation of these lattices is impaired by their nondistributivity and by various other problems. We show that a possible resolution of these difficulties, suggested by the ideas of Bohr, emerges if instead of single projections one considers elementary propositions to be families of projections indexed by a partially ordered set of appropriate commutative subalgebras of A. In fact, to achieve both maximal generality and ease of use within topos theory, we assume that A is a so-called Rickart C-algebra and that consists of all unital commutative Rickart C-subalgebras of A. Such families of projections form a Heyting algebra in a natural way, so that the associated propositional logic is intuitionistic: distributivity is recovered at the expense of the law of the excluded middle. Subsequently, generalizing an earlier computation for n x n matrices, we prove that the Heyting algebra thus associated to A arises as a basis for the internal Gelfand spectrum in the sense of Banaschewski-Mulvey of the Bohrification of A, which is a commutative Rickart C-algebra in the topos of functors from to the category of sets. We explain the relationship of this construction to partial Boolean algebras and Bruns-Lakser completions. Finally, we establish a connection between probability measures on the lattice of projections on a Hilbert space H and probability valuations on the internal Gelfand spectrum of for A  BH.','<b>Title: </b>Does the deduction theorem fail for modal logic<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> R. Hakli and  S.

It is shown here that the apparent problem arises from an objectionable notion of derivability from assumptions in an axiomatic system. When a traditional Hilbert-type system of axiomatic logic is generalized into a system for derivations from assumptions, the necessitation rule has to be modified in a way that restricts its use to cases in which the premiss does not depend on assumptions. This restriction is entirely analogous to the restriction of the rule of universal generalization of first-order logic. A necessitation rule with this restriction permits a proof of the deduction theorem in its usual formulation. Other suggestions presented in the literature to deal with the problem are reviewed, and the present solution is argued to be preferable to the other alternatives. A contraction- and cut-free sequent calculus equivalent to the Hilbert system for basic modal logic shows the standard failure argument untenable by proving the underivability of from A.','<b>Title: </b>Priors individuals<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> H.

That criticism extends to the widespread preference which Prior initiated for an operator analysis of expressions like It is true, known, obligatory that p as opposed to the predicative analysis in their equivalents That p is true, known, obligatory. The criticism in the present work also concerns Priors attitude to Platonic entities of a certain kind: not propositions, i.e., the referents of that-clauses, but individuals, i.e., the referents of Russells logically proper names. Prior had a close knowledge of theories of individuals, including that of Russell. However, when Prior formulated his tense logic Q he presumed a non-Russellian, pre-suppositional account of individuals, such that they might exist at one time but not at another, and when they did not exist no statement could be made about them. This paper examines the correctness of such a pre-suppositional account of individuals, showing there are features of natural language it cannot account for. It is shown that the required features can be formalised in Hilberts epsilon calculus, and that using that calculus substantiates a Russellian understanding of logically proper names.','<b>Title: </b>On the mereological structure of complex states of affairs<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> T.

For this task tools from graph theory, lattice theory, and the theory of relational systems are employed. Our starting point is the mereology of similarity structures. Since similarity structures are structured sets, their mereology can be considered as a generalization of the mereology of ordinary sets. In general, the mereological systems arising from similarity structures turn out to be not Boolean but Heyting systems. Employing Armstrongs notion of thick particulars, similarity structures are shown to capture the mereological structure of complex chemical states of affairs such as being butane or being isobutane; structural universals are not needed.','<b>Title: </b>Abstraction in ecology: reductionism and holism as complementary heuristics<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> J.

There are methods to investigate whether simplifying assumptions bias the results of models, such as robustness analyses. However, the equally important issue - the focus of this paper - has received less attention, namely, what are the methodological and epistemic strengths and limitations associated with different simplifying assumptions. I concentrate on one type of simplifying assumption, the use of mega parameters as abstractions in ecological models. First, I argue that there are two kinds of mega parameters qua abstractions, sufficient parameters and aggregative parameters, which have gone unnoticed in the literature. The two are associated with different heuristics, holism and reductionism, which many view as incompatible. Second, I will provide a different analysis of abstractions and the associated heuristics than previous authors. Reductionism and holism and the accompanying abstractions have different methodological and epistemic functions, strengths, and limitations, and the heuristics should be viewed as providing complementary research perspectives of cognitively limited beings. This is then, third, used as a premise to argue for epistemic and methodological pluralism in theoretical ecology. Finally, the presented taxonomy of abstractions is used to comment on the current debate whether mechanistic accounts of explanation are compatible with the use of abstractions. This debate has suffered from an abstract discussion of abstractions. With a better taxonomy of abstractions the debate can be resolved.','<b>Title: </b>Reasoning about data and information<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> P.

They employ respectively higher-order and first-order logic to model certain natural language inferences and claim that the natural language conclusions carry commitment to abstract objects, partially because their renderings in those formal systems seem to do that. I argue that this strategy fails because the nominalist can accept those natural language consequences, provide them with plausible and non-committing truth conditions and account for the inferences made without committing themselves to abstract objects. I sketch a modal account of higher-order quantification, on which instead of ranging over sets, higher order quantifiers are used to make logical possibility claims about which predicate tokens can be introduced. This approach provides an alternative account of truth conditions for natural language sentences which seem to employ higher-order quantification, thus allowing the nominalist to evade Salmons argument. I also show how the nominalist can account for the occurrence of apparently singular abstract terms in certain true statements. I argue that the nominalist can achieve this by, first, dividing singular terms into real singular terms referring to concrete objects and only apparent singular terms called onomatoids, introduced for the sake of brevity and simplicity, and then providing an account of nominalistically acceptable truth conditions of sentences containing onomatoids. I develop such an account in terms of modally interpreted abstraction principles and argue that applying this strategy to Soamess argument allows the nominalists to defend themselves.One would hope and perhaps conjecture that the whole general set theory, however beautiful it is, will in the future disappear. With the higher types Platonism begins. The tendencies of Chwistek and others Nominalism of speaking only of what can be named are healthy.

This campaign failed, however, presumably in part due to serious ontological concerns haunting such disorders. Here, I offer a path to quell such ontological concerns, adding to previous conceptual work by Jerome Wakefield and Christian Perring. Specifically, I adduce reasons to think that collective disorders are compatible with key metaphysical commitments of contemporary scientific psychiatry, and argue that if one accepts the existence of mental disorders in individuals as medical, then one has good reasons to accept the existence of collective disorders as medical. First, I outline how collective disorders are reconcilable with both the harmful dysfunction model of disorder and a denial of mind-body dualism. I then identify some potential weaknesses in the main pre-existing example of a collective disorder, offering my own examples as supplements. These examples medical plausibility is bolstered by: 1 work in philosophy of biology on the generalized selected effects theory of function largely from Justin Garson, and 2 work in analytic philosophy of mind on collective mentality largely from Bryce Huebner. Finally, after offering preliminary responses to the objection that the recognition of collective disorders may lead to an overpathologization of everyday life, I spell out ways in which this recognition may have empowering effects for some would-be patients; for example, by providing substance to the notion of a sane response to an insane world.','<b>Title: </b>Whos afraid of ceteris-paribus laws Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love them<br><b>Year: </b>2002<br><b>Author: </b> M.

Ceteris-paribus laws teach us that a law need not be associated straightforwardly with a regularity in the manner demanded by regularity analyses of law and analyses of laws as relations among universals. This lesson enables us to understand the sense in which the laws of nature would have been no different under various counterfactual suppositions a feature even of those laws that involve no ceteris-paribus qualification and are actually associated with exceptionless regularities. Ceteris-paribus generalizations of an inexact science qualify as laws of that science in virtue of their distinctive relation to counterfactuals: they form a set that is stable for the purposes of that field. Though an accident may possess tremendous resilience under counterfactual suppositions, the laws are sharply distinguished from the accidents in that the laws are collectively as resilient as they could logically possibly be. The stability of an inexact sciences laws may involve their remaining reliable even under certain counterfactual suppositions violating fundamental laws of physics. The ceteris-paribus laws of an inexact science may thus possess a kind of necessity lacking in the fundamental laws of physics. A nomological explanation supplied by an inexact science would then be irreducible to an explanation of the same phenomenon at the level of fundamental physics. Island biogeography is used to illustrate how a special science could be autonomous in this manner.','<b>Title: </b>Knowledge and the permissibility of action<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> Na.

The new formulation involves a ceteris paribus clause. Though it is often difficult to specify the exact content of a ceteris paribus clause, we will see that our clause is derived from a descriptive generalization with independent motivation.','<b>Title: </b>A Stochastic Graphs Semantics for Conditionals<br><b>Year: </b><br><b>Author: </b> K.

It also yields a powerful method of handling more complex issues such as nested conditionals. The stochastic graph semantics provides a satisfactory answer to Lewiss arguments against the PC  CP principle, and defends important intuitions which connect the notion of probability of a conditional with the standard notion of conditional probability. It also illustrates the general problem of finding formal explications of philosophically important notions and applying mathematical methods in analyzing philosophical issues.','<b>Title: </b>The Gibbs Paradox and the Definition of Entropy in Statistical Mechanics<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> Pm.

Laws of nature are to be understood in terms of what just happens, not vice versa. Here the Humean needs some conception of what it is that just happens - a conception of the Humean mosaic. Lewiss Humeanism incorporates such a conception in the form of a Lewis-style metaphysics of objects, properties, and modality. Newer versions of Humeanism about laws of nature, such as the Better Best Systems approach BBS, typically reject such a Lewisian metaphysics, but it remains unclear what they can offer in its place. By exploring different candidate conceptions, this paper sheds light on the limits of Humeanism about laws of nature: not all conceptions of the Humean mosaic form a suitable basis for a Humean theory of laws. In fact, only a metaphysics roughly in line with Lewiss will do. The paper ends with a tentative generalization of this result, thus pointing to the limit of Humeanism in general: taking the Humean way of thinking to its limit results in a rejection of the whole idea of such a mosaic - and hence of Humean mosaic-based accounts of anything.','<b>Title: </b>What is normal An evolution-theoretic foundation for normic laws and their relation to statistical normality<br><b>Year: </b>2001<br><b>Author: </b> G.

This paper presents a foundation for normic laws which is based on generalized evolution theory and explains their omnipresence, lawlikeness, and reliability. It is argued that the fact that normic laws are a product of evolution must establish a systematic connection between prototypical and statistical normality.','<b>Title: </b>On what inferentially justifies what: the vices of reliabilism and proper functionalism<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> C.

The only sort of modal force that distinguishes natural laws, I will argue, arises from the peculiar physical property of mutual independence of elementary interactions exemplifying the laws. Mutual independence of elementary interactions means that their existence and their nature do not depend in any way on which other interactions presently occur. It is exactly this general physical property of elementary interactions in the actual world that provides natural laws with their specific modal force and grounds the experience of natures recalcitrance. Thus, the modal force of natural laws is explained by contingent non-modal properties of nature. In the second part of the paper, I deal with some alleged counterexamples to my approach: constraint laws, compositional laws, symmetry principles and conservation laws. These sorts of laws turn out to be compatible with my approach: constraint laws and compositional laws do not represent the dynamics of interaction-types by themselves, but only as constitutive parts of a complete set of equations, whereas symmetry principles and conservation laws do not represent any specific dynamics, but only impose general constraints on possible interactions.','<b>Title: </b>Empress vs. Spider-Man: Margaret Cavendish on pure and applied mathematics<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Contrary to the suggestion of various champions of the semantic view, it is argued that this approach does not make support for a plausible scientific realism any less problematic than it might otherwise be. Though a degree of independence of theory from language may ensure safety from pitfalls associated with logical empiricism, realism cannot be entertained unless models or abstracted and/or idealized aspects thereof are spelled out in terms of linguistic formulations such as mathematical equations, which can be interpreted in terms of correspondence with the world. The putative advantage of the semantic approach - its linguistic independence - is thus of no help to the realist.

He was also a critical epistemological realist. Further, in spite of the instrumentalist flavour of his reductionist programme in eliminating terms apparently referring to abstract entities, Kotarbinski accepted theories as statements with truth values and theoretical entities as long as they can be understood as physical bodies.','<b>Title: </b>The pessimistic induction: a bad argument gone too far<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> M.

The paper explores some consequences of this attitude and takes some steps towards the realization of this program. The general idea is to develop a meaning theory, and consequently a formal semantics, based on the idea that knowing the meaning of a sentence is tantamount to having a criterion for establishing what is a justification for it. Section 1 motivates a requirement of epistemic transparency imposed onto justifications conceived as mental states. In Section 2, the formal notion of justification for an atomic formula is defined, in terms of the notion of cognitive state. In Section 3, the definition is extended to logically complex formulas. In Section 4, the notion of truth-ground is introduced and is used to give a definition of logical validity.','<b>Title: </b>In Defense of Reflection<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> Sm.

Floridi<br><b>Journal: </b>ERKENNTNIS<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>Semantic information is usually supposed to satisfy the veridicality thesis: p qualifies as semantic information only if p is true. However, what it means for semantic information to be true is often left implicit, with correspondentist interpretations representing the most popular, default option. The article develops an alternative approach, namely a correctness theory of truth CTT for semantic information. This is meant as a contribution not only to the philosophy of information but also to the philosophical debate on the nature of truth. After the introduction, in Sect. 2, semantic information is shown to be translatable into propositional semantic information i. In Sect. 3, i is polarised into a query Q and a result R, qualified by a specific context, a level of abstraction and a purpose. This polarization is normalised in Sect. 4, where Q  R is transformed into a Boolean question and its relative yes/no answer Q  A. This completes the reduction of the truth of i to the correctness of A. In Sects. 5 and 6, it is argued that 1 A is the correct answer to Q if and only if 2 A correctly saturates Q by verifying and validating it in the computer sciences sense of verification and validation; that 2 is the case if and only if 3 Q  A generates an adequate model m of the relevant system s identified by Q; that 3 is the case if and only if 4 m is a proxy of s in the computer sciences sense of proxy and 5 proximal access to m commutes with the distal access to s in the category theorys sense of commutation; and that 5 is the case if and only if 6 reading/writing accessing, in the computer sciences technical sense of the term m enables one to read/write access s. Sect. 7 provides some further clarifications about CTT, in the light of semantic paradoxes. Section 8 draws a general conclusion about the nature of CTT as a theory for systems designers not just systems users. In the course of the article all technical expressions from computer science are explained.','<b>Title: </b>The difference between indexicals and demonstratives<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> A.

The tradition would generally count it as a demonstrative, because the speakers intentions play a role in providing it with a semantic value. I present cross-linguistic data and explanations offered of the data in typology and semantics to show that you belongs on the indexical side, and argue that they can be generalized to a novel criterion for distinguishing between indexicals and demonstratives. The central theoretical claim is that the semantic values of indexicals are objects which play certain utterance-related roles, which are fixed independently of the words being used in the utterance. For instance, the speaker plays the speaker role whether or not she uses the word I, and the addressee plays that role whether or not the speaker uses the word you. Demonstratives, on the other hand, pick out objects that play no such role, and are instead helped by the speakers word-specific intentions.','<b>Title: </b>The defeasible nature of coherentist justification<br><b>Year: </b>2007<br><b>Author: </b> S.

Therefore, propositions are not structured objects.','<b>Title: </b>From colliding billiard balls to colluding desperate housewives: causal Bayes nets as rational models of everyday causal reasoning<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> Y.

Nevertheless, only recently has it been claimed that people use causal models when making judgments, decisions and predictions, and that causal Bayes nets allow us to formally describe these inferences. Experimental research has been limited to simple, artificial problems, which are unrepresentative of the complex dynamic systems we successfully deal with in everyday life. For instance, in social interactions, we can explain the actions of others on the fly and we can generalize from limited observations to predict future actions and their consequences. Our main argument is that none of these inferences i.e., induction, generalization, explanation, and prediction can be achieved without causal reasoning. As a case in point we use the popular television series desperate housewives and show how causal Bayes nets are able to explain the inferences made in social contexts. Crucially, causal Bayes nets also allow us to understand why we can infer so much from so little when making sense of a protagonists behavior.','<b>Title: </b>Revising the concept of lawhood: special sciences and natural kinds<br><b>Year: </b>2008<br><b>Author: </b> Ae. Karbasizadeh<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>The Kripkean conception of natural kinds kinds are defined by essences that are intrinsic to their members and that lie at the microphysical level indirectly finds support in a certain conception of a law of nature, according to which generalizations must have unlimited scope and be exceptionless to count as laws of nature. On my view, the kinds that constitute the subject matter of special sciences such as biology may very well turn out to be natural despite the fact that their essences fail to be microphysical or micro-based. On the causal conception of natural kinds I privilege, the naturalness of a kind is a function of the fact that it figures prominently in at least one causal law. However, there is a strong tendency prevailing among contemporary philosophers to assume that, in order to count as proper laws generalizations must be expectionless. Since most generalizations tracked down by the special sciences turn out not to fulfill these criteria, what this conception of a law implies is that most of the generalizations the special sciences trade in are not proper laws. It follows that, on this view, most if not all of the kinds the special sciences dealing with turn out not to constitute natural kinds, understood as kinds to which bona fide laws apply. In order to establish that the non-microstructurally defined kinds that fall within the domain of enquiry of the special sciences are eligible for the status of natural kind, I must therefore establish that generalizations neednt have unlimited scope and be exceptionless to count as laws of nature. This is precisely what I seek to do in this paper. I begin by arguing that the question what is a law of nature is most naturally interpreted as the question what features must generalizations exhibit in order to ground scientific explanations and by offering reasons to believe that generalizations neednt be exceptionless and have unlimited scope to play the crucial role laws have been thought to play in scientific explanation. Drawing on Sandra Mitchell Mitchell, S. 2000. Philosophy of Science, 67, 242-265 and James Woodwards Woodward, J. 1997. Philosophy of science, 64 proceedings, 524-541; Woodward, J. 2000. British Journal for the philosophy of science, 512, 197-254; Woodward, J. 2001. Philosophy of science, 68, 1-20 work, I subsequently develop an alternative account of the criteria generalizations must satisfy in order to count as laws of nature, which at least some of the generalizations of the special sciences turn out to fulfill. I thus give credence to the idea that at least some of the kinds that fall within the domain of the special sciences figure in laws of nature, and I thereby restore the possibility that some special science kinds deserve to be deemed natural.','<b>Title: </b>Entitlement as a response to I-II-III scepticism<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> P.

Quines argument for the existence of abstract mathematical objects differs from the argument which many philosophers of mathematics ascribe to him. Contrary to appearances, Putnam did not argue for the existence of abstract mathematical objects at all. I close by suggesting that attention to Quine and Putnams writings reveals some neglected arguments for platonism which may be superior to the indispensability argument.','<b>Title: </b>The case for regularity in mechanistic causal explanation<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> H.

This taxonomy allows precise explication of the degree and location of regular operation within a mechanism, and highlights the role that various kinds of regularity play in scientific explanation. I defend this regularity requirement in terms of regularitys role in individuating mechanisms against a background of other causal processes, and by prioritizing mechanisms ability to serve as a model of scientific explanation, rather than as a metaphysical account of causation. It is because mechanisms are regular, in the expanded sense described here, that they are capable of supporting the kinds of generalizations that figure prominently in scientific explanations.','<b>Title: </b>Do Statistical Laws Solve the Problem of Provisos<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> A.

I present two challenges to the statistical account. According to the first challenge, the statistical account does not get rid of so-called non-lazy ceteris paribus conditions. This result undermines one of the alleged and central advantages of the statistical account. The second challenge is that the statistical account, qua general theory of special science laws, is weakened by the fact that idealized law statements resist a purely statistical interpretation.','<b>Title: </b>Defeasibility and the normative grasp of context<br><b>Year: </b>2004<br><b>Author: </b> M.

I discuss two ways in which this extension offers further development of the mechanistic view. First, functional individuation of mechanisms in engineering science proceeds by means of two distinct sub types of role function, behavior function and effect function, rather than role function simpliciter. Second, it offers refined assessment of the explanatory power of mechanistic explanations. It is argued that in the context of malfunction explanations of technical systems, two key desiderata for mechanistic explanations, completeness and specificity and abstraction, pull in opposite directions. I elaborate a novel explanatory desideratum to accommodate this explanatory context, dubbed local specificity and global abstraction, and further argue that it also holds for mechanistic explanations of malfunctions in the biological domain. The overall result is empirically-informed understanding of mechanistic explanation in engineering science, thus contributing to the ongoing project of understanding mechanistic explanation in novel or relatively unexplored domains. I illustrate these claims in terms of reverse engineering and malfunction explanations in engineering science.','<b>Title: </b>Commuting probability revisions: The uniformity rule<br><b>Year: </b>2003<br><b>Author: </b> Cg.

First, the revised argument has no need for Kims causal exclusion principle, which many find dubious if not simply false. Second, the revised argument can be adapted to either a production-based conception of causation, as Kim himself favors, or to any of a number of dependence-based conceptions, like the ones favored by many of Kims critics. And, finally, the revised argument does not have the objectionable consequence that all so-called higher-level properties are epiphenomenal, for it does not generalize in the way that Kims original version of the argument arguably does. Nor does it concede much to narrow the scope of the argument in the way proposed. Those who adopt nonreductive theories of mind do so, by and large, on the strength of functionalist arguments for the multiple realizability of mental states. If functionalism entails that mental properties are epiphenomenal, this thus deals a critical, if not quite fatal, blow to nonreductivism.','<b>Title: </b>Is open-mindedness truth-conducive<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> Bjc.

Even when reduction fails, two theories or fields can be unified integrated in significant ways. I highlight two largely independent dimensions of unification. Fields are theoretically unified to the extent that we understand how the ontologies, concepts, and generalizations of these fields are connected. Reductionism is one form of theoretical unity, but not the only form. Fields are practically unified through heuristic connections e.g., using the heuristics of one field to generate hypotheses in another field and by the development of methods for integrating the qualitatively distinct bodies of data generated by the two fields. I discuss the relationship between paleontological and neontological systematics to illustrate the utility of conceptualizing unity as interconnection.','<b>Title: </b>Trope theory and the Bradley regress<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> As.

We concern ourselves with its topological and spatiotemporal aspects, abstracting from the nature or mechanism of chancy processes. We first argue that the question arises in Montague-Lewis-Earman conceptualization of indeterminism as well as in the branching tradition of Prior, Thomason and Belnap. As the resources of the former school are not rich enough to study topological issues, we investigate the question in the framework of branching space-times of Belnap Synthese 92: 385-434, 1992. We introduce a topology on a branching model as well as a topology on a history in a branching model. We define light-cones and assume four conditions that guarantee the light-cones so defined behave like light-cones of physical space-times. From among various topological separation properties that are relevant to our question, we investigate the Hausdorff property. We prove that each history in a branching model satisfies the Hausdorff property. As for the satisfaction of the Hausdorff property in the entire branching model, we prove that it is related to the phenomenon of passive indeterminism, which we describe in detail.','<b>Title: </b>On the Choice of Algebra for Quantization<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> Bh.

For the most part, our issue is independent of the details of any resolution of the Bad Company objection and, as we will show, it concerns other foundational approaches in the philosophy of mathematics. In the first two sections, we give a brief overview of the Scottish neo-logicist school, present a generic form of the Bad Company objection and introduce an epistemic issue connected to this general problem that will be the focus of the rest of the paper. In the third section, we present an alternative approach within philosophy of mathematics, a view that emerges from Hilberts Grundlagen der Geometrie 1899, Leipzig: Teubner; Foundations of geometry trans.: Townsend, E.. La Salle, Illinois: Open Court, 1959.. We will argue that Bad Company-style worries, and our concomitant epistemic issue, also affects this conception and other foundationalist approaches. In the following sections, we then offer various ways to address our epistemic concern, arguing, in the end, that none resolves the issue. The final section offers our own resolution which, however, runs against the foundationalist spirit of the Scottish neo-logicist program.','<b>Title: </b>The Undergeneration of Permutation Invariance as a Criterion for Logicality<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> Cd.

The basic idea is that one can demarcate the realm of logic by isolating specific entities-logical notions or constants-and that permutation invariance would provide a philosophically motivated and technically sophisticated criterion for what counts as a logical notion. The thesis of permutation invariance as a criterion for logicality has received considerable attention in the literature in recent decades, and much of the debate is developed against the background of ideas put forth by Tarski in a 1966 lecture Tarski 1966/1986. But as noted by Tarski himself in the lecture, the permutation invariance criterion yields a class of putative logical constants that are essentially only sensitive to the number of elements in classes of individuals. Thus, to hold the permutation invariance thesis essentially amounts to limiting the scope of logic to quantificational phenomena, which is controversial at best and possibly simply wrong. In this paper, I argue that permutation invariance is a misguided approach to the nature of logic because it is not an adequate formal explanans for the informal notion of the generality of logic. In particular, I discuss some cases of undergeneration of the criterion, i.e. the fact that it excludes from the realm of logic operators that we have good reason to regard as logical, especially some modal operators.','<b>Title: </b>Drift and Statistically Abstractive Explanation<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> M.

Statistically abstractive explanation SA explanation mandates the suppression of factors probabilistically relevant to an explanandum when these factors are extraneous to the theoretical project being pursued. When these factors are suppressed, the explanandum is rendered uncertain. But this uncertainty traces to the theoretically constrained character of SA explanation, not to any real indeterminacy. Random genetic drift is an artifact of such uncertainty, and it is therefore wrong to reify it as a cause of evolution or as a process in its own right.','<b>Title: </b>Maximal and perimaximal contraction<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> So.

Belief contraction should proceed by selection among these viable options. Several contraction operators that are based on such selection mechanisms are introduced and then axiomatically characterized. These constructions are more general than the belief base approach. It is shown that partial meet contraction is exactly characterized by adding to one of these constructions the condition that all logically closed subsets of the belief set can be obtained as the outcome of a single multiple contraction. Examples are provided showing the counter-intuitive consequences of that condition, thus confirming the credibility of the proposed generalization of the AGM framework.','<b>Title: </b>What distinguishes data from models<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> S.

I then argue that whether a set of objects functions as data or models does not depend on intrinsic differences in their physical properties, level of abstraction or the degree of human intervention involved in generating them, but rather on their distinctive roles towards identifying and characterizing the targets of investigation. The paper thus proposes a characterization of data models that builds on Suppes attention to data practices, without however needing to posit a fixed hierarchy of data and models or a highly exclusionary definition of data models as statistical constructs.','<b>Title: </b>The scientist as child<br><b>Year: </b>1996<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Both science and cognitive development involve abstract, coherent systems of entities and rules, theories. In both cases, theories provide predictions, explanations, and interpretations. In both, theories change in characteristic ways in response to counterevidence. These ideas are illustrated by an account of childrens developing understanding of the mind.','<b>Title: </b>Degrees of Causation<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> M. Braham and  M.

Proof-theoretically, we show that questions may be used in inferences as placeholders for arbitrary information of a given type; by manipulating such placeholders, we may construct formal proofs of dependencies. Finally, we show that such proofs have a specific kind of constructive content: they do not just witness the existence of a certain dependency, but actually encode a method for transforming information of the types described by the assumptions into information of the type described by the conclusion.','<b>Title: </b>Functional individuation, mechanistic implementation: the proper way of seeing the mechanistic view of concrete computation<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> Dc. Mollo<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>I examine a major objection to the mechanistic view of concrete computation, stemming from an apparent tension between the abstract nature of computational explanation and the tenets of the mechanistic framework: while computational explanation is medium-independent, the mechanistic framework insists on the importance of providing some degree of structural detail about the systems target of the explanation. I show that a common reply to the objection, i.e. that mechanistic explanation of computational systems involves only weak structural constraints, is not enough to save the standard mechanistic view of computation-it trivialises the appeal to mechanism, and thus makes the account collapse into a purely functional view. I claim, however, that the objection can be put to rest once the account is appropriately amended: computational individuation is indeed functional, while mechanistic explanation plays a role in accounting for computational implementation. Since individuation and implementation are crucial elements in a satisfying account of computation in physical systems, mechanism keeps its central importance in the theory of concrete computation. Finally, I argue that my version of the mechanistic view helps to provide a convincing reply to a powerful objection against non-semantic theories of concrete computation: the argument from the multiplicity of computations.','<b>Title: </b>Structural Realism and the Relationship between the Special Sciences and Physics<br><b>Year: </b>2008<br><b>Author: </b> J.

We distinguish between negative and positive notions of malfunction. A negative malfunction, or dysfunction, occurs when an artefact token either does not sometimes or cannot ever do what it is supposed to. A positive malfunction, or misfunction, occurs when an artefact token may do what is supposed to but, at least occasionally, it also yields some unintended and undesirable effects. We argue that software, understood as type, may misfunction in some limited sense, but cannot dysfunction. Accordingly, one should distinguish software from other technical artefacts, in view of their design that makes dysfunction impossible for the former, while possible for the latter.','<b>Title: </b>Whats the Problem with the Cosmological Constant<br><b>Year: </b>2020<br><b>Author: </b> Md.

But in my view, simple cases of adverbial modification add to the reasons for rejecting this hypothesis, even though Davidson rightly diagnosed many implications involving adverbs as cases of conjunct-reduction in the scope of an existential quantifier. I think the puzzles in this vicinity reflect framing effects, which reveal the implausibility of certain assumptions about how linguistic meaning is related to truth and logical form. We need to replace these assumptions with alternatives, instead of positing implausible values of event-variables or implausible relativizations of truth to linguistic descriptions of actual events.I find myself writing two papers that are due around the same time. This one develops an objection, based on Davidsons 1967a analysis of action reports, to truth-theoretic accounts of linguistic meaning. The other one is about the relevance of Liar Paradoxes for such accounts; see Pietroski forthcoming. In both papers, the first numbered sentence is 1.1 The first numbered sentence in Framing Event Variables is false.But here, 1 is simply a reminder of a familiar difficulty for the idea that declarative sentences of a Human Language have truth conditions; where for these purposes, a Human Language is a spoken or signed language that any biologically normal child can acquire given an ordinary course of linguistic experience. In my view, 2 and 3 present further difficulties for this idea.2 Alvin chased Theodore gleefully and athletically but not skillfully.3 Theodore chased Alvin gleelessly and unathletically but skillfully.Following Davidson and others, I think action reports have eventish logical forms like 2a, 3a.2a there exists eChased e, Alvin, Theodore  Gleefule  Athletice  similar to Skillfule3a there exists eChasede, Theodore, Alvin  Gleelesse  Unathletice  Skillfule We can stipulate that the existential generalizations-sentences of an invented language-have recursively specifiable truth conditions, and that Chased e, x, y is true of <alpha, beta, gamma > if and only if alpha was an event of beta chasing gamma. But as well see, there are good reasons for denying that 2 and 3 exhibit the specified truth conditions. There are potential replies. But I argue that they are implausible, especially given the many independent illustrations e.g., via Kahneman and Tversky of how human judgments are affected by linguistic framing.','<b>Title: </b>A unified account of the conjunction fallacy by coherence<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> Ml.

Nevertheless, two facets of the proposal have not been sufficiently stressed. On the one hand, it is a non-collapse formalism that should be technically appropriate to supply descriptions based on quantum properties at different times. On the other hand, it intends to provide an interpretation of quantum mechanics that solves the traditional puzzles of the theory. In this article we spell out the main criticisms to TQH and classify them into two groups: theoretical and interpretive. Whereas the latter might be ignored if the TQH were considered as a quantum formalism with its minimum interpretation, the former seems to point toward technical difficulties that must be faced in a theoretically adequate proposal. Precisely with the purpose of solving these difficulties, we introduce a different perspective, called Formalism of Generalized Contexts or Formalism of Contextual Histories FCH, which supplies a precise condition for consistently talking of quantum properties at different times without the theoretical shortcomings of the TQH.','<b>Title: </b>On the Brussels schools arrow of time in quantum theory<br><b>Year: </b>1996<br><b>Author: </b> V.

It is concluded that the Brussels schools conception of microscopic temporal irreversibility, as such, is tacitly assumed at the macroscopic level. Finally a logical argument is provided which shows, independently of the mathematical formalism of the theory concerned, that statistical reasoning alone is not sufficient to explain the arrow of time.','<b>Title: </b>Transparency and introspective unification<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> K.

This observation of what has become known as belief transparency has formed a basis for a cluster of views on the nature of introspection. These views may be well suited to account for our introspective access to beliefs, but whether similar transparency-based accounts of our introspective access to mental states other than belief can be given is not obvious. The question of whether a transparency-based account can be generalized beyond beliefs is part of the larger issue whether introspection of different mental states can receive broadly the same account-whether introspection is unified. My aim is to examine one particularly thorough attempt at generalizing a transparency-based account of introspection due to Alex Byrne. I argue that the resulting view does not offer a unified account of introspection, even across a handful of mental states. In doing so, I highlight two difficulties most views on introspection that try to offer a unified account would have to face, even if they are not based in belief transparency. The subsequent move away from introspective unification has ramifications for several other philosophical debates, such as the architecture of the mind and our rationality.','<b>Title: </b>On the possibility of a substantive theory of truth<br><b>Year: </b>1998<br><b>Author: </b> G.

Although they are ubiquitous in natural language, when used in a logical context, vague predicates lead to contradiction. This paper will address a question that is intimately related to this problem. Given their inherent imprecision, why do vague predicates arise in the first place I discuss a variation of the signaling game where the state space is treated as contiguous, i.e., endowed with a metric that captures a similarity relation over states. This added structure is manifested in payoffs that reward approximate coordination between sender and receiver as well as perfect coordination. I evolve these games using a variation of Herrnstein reinforcement learning that better reflects the generalizing learning strategies real-world actors use in situations where states of the world are similar. In these simulations, signaling can develop very quickly, and the signals are vague in much the way ordinary language predicates are vague-they each exclusively apply to certain items, but for some transition period both signals apply to varying degrees. Moreover, I show that under certain parameter values, in particular when state spaces are large and time is limited, learning generalization of this sort yields strategies with higher payoffs than standard Herrnstein reinforcement learning. These models may then help explain why the phenomenon of vagueness arises in natural language: the learning strategies that allow actors to quickly and effectively develop signaling conventions in contiguous state spaces make it unavoidable.','<b>Title: </b>RELIABILITY IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS<br><b>Year: </b>1993<br><b>Author: </b> M.

Hence, it is surprising that the literature lacks any discussion on how to update ones imprecise credences when the given evidence itself is imprecise. To fill this gap, I consider two updating principles. Unfortunately, each of them faces a serious problem. The first updating principle, which I call generalized conditionalization, sometimes forces an agent to change her imprecise degrees of belief even though she does not have new evidence. The second updating principle, which I call the generalized dynamic Keynesian model, may result in a very precise credal state although the agent does not have sufficiently strong evidence to justify such an informative doxastic state. This means that it is much more difficult to come up with an acceptable updating principle for the imprecise credence framework than one might have thought it would be.','<b>Title: </b>Concepts are not a natural kind<br><b>Year: </b>2005<br><b>Author: </b> E.

The purpose of the logic is to explicate the conceptual machinery implicit in the dialogue-game model of rational discourse developed in Carlson 1983. A variety of ideas and techniques of modal and philosophical logic are used to define a model structure that generalizes the game theoretical notion of a game in extensive form von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944. Relative to this model structure, semantic characterizations are given to the action-theoretic notions of time, possibility, belief, preference, ability, intention, action, and rationality. The unification of these characterizations under the game-theoretical paradigm leads to insights about the logical interdependences between these concepts.The resulting theory of rational interaction is applied to the explication of rational dialogue. The main benefit of the enterprise for a theory of rational dialogue is that concepts and results of game theory become accessible to the explication of dialogue. In particular, the task of proving the logical coherence of a discourse is reduced to the task of showing the rationality of strategy choices made in an associated dialogue game.','<b>Title: </b>Can Sellars argument for scientific realism be used against his own scientia mensura principle<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> D.

However, interestingly enough, Lange takes himself to be a Sellarsian and does not put forward his claim as an explicitly anti-Sellarsian one. It will be argued that Langes argument against the layer-cake view is not strictly speaking Sellarsian, since Lange interprets Sellars argument in an overly abstract or formal manner. Moreover, I will suggest that, within a properly Sellarsian context, Langes argument against the layer-cake picture can actually be used for quite un- Langean purposes, namely in order to show that folk-psychological descriptions and explanations are not if fact autonomous. However, Lange could insist that his reconstruction of Sellars argument is substantially correct irrespectively of how Sellars himself understood it and he does have the resources to do so. I will propose that the substantial issue between Lange and Sellars turns on their different views on the function of ceteris-paribus clauses, and ultimately, on issues about the unity of science. Finally, it will be suggested that the Sellarsian framework for tackling these issues constitutes a viable alternative to Langes picture of theoretical explanation, while at the same time incorporating be the sound insights of the latter.','<b>Title: </b>On the meaning of Hilberts consistency problem Paris, 1900<br><b>Year: </b>2003<br><b>Author: </b> E.

I then analyze the notion of approximation to the ideal of coherence by developing a generalized theory of belief functions that allows for incoherence, and showing how such belief functions can be ordered with regard to greater or lesser coherence.','<b>Title: </b>About the warrants of computer-based empirical knowledge<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Our strategy consists in acknowledging the complexity of scientific practice, and trying to assess its rationality. Hence, while we are careful not to abstract away from the details of scientific practice, our approach is not strictly descriptive: our goal is to state in what conditions empirical science can rely on computer simulations. In order to do so, we need to adopt a renewed epistemological framework, whose categories would enable us to give a finer-grained, and better-fitted analysis of the rationality of scientific practice.','<b>Title: </b>How the Modalities Come into the World<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> W.

In detail, the paper explains: 1 Already the basic fact that the world is a world of states of affairs is due to the nature of our epistemic states. 2 Objects and properties and relations, which figure in states of affairs and which embody metaphysical modality, are constitutable by their essential properties and in fact constituted by us according to our ontological policies. 3 What the facts are, to which the correspondence notion of truth refers, is determined by applying an epistemic or pragmatic notion of truth to the world. 4 Causation is a specific objectivization of our conditional beliefs. 5 Nomicity is a habit of belief Ramsey, a specific way of generalizing epistemic attitudes. This covers the basic metaphysical and natural modalities.

I argue that scientists use designated similarities between models and aspects of the world to form both hypotheses and generalizations.','<b>Title: </b>Uncertainty, credal sets and second order probability<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> Jc.

In that time, there has also been much progress made in credal set theory-another generalization of the traditional Bayesian epistemic representation-albeit not in this particular area. In credal set theory, sets of probability functions are utilized to represent the epistemic state of rational agents instead of the single probability function of traditional Bayesian theory. The Shannon entropy has been shown to uniquely capture certain highly intuitive properties of uncertainty, and can thus be considered a measure of that quantity. This article presents two measures developed with the purpose of generalizing the Shannon entropy for 1 unordered convex credal sets and 2 possibly non-convex credal sets ordered by second order probability, thereby providing uncertainty measures for such epistemic representations. There is also a comparison with the results of the measure AU developed within Dempster-Shafer theory in a few instances where unordered convex credal set theory and Dempster-Shafer theory overlap.','<b>Title: </b>Abstraction and the Organization of Mechanisms<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> A.

Thus, in an effort to sketch an alternative that does not rely primarily on peer pressure, I draw on the work of C. S. Peirce. Peirce argued that, when we reason, we manipulate abstract diagrams in order to observe what results. Since some manipulations are barred by the self-same nature of the diagrams, I try to show that this qualitative incompatibility, which I dub contrapiction, is a good non-social reason to regard some reasoning as bad.','<b>Title: </b>Taking stock of infinite value: Pascals Wager and relative utilities<br><b>Year: </b>2007<br><b>Author: </b> P.

The first is that decision theory, and specifically the requirement of maximizing expected utility, is incompatible with infinite utility values. The second is that even if infinite utility values are admitted, the argument of the Wager is invalid provided that we allow mixed strategies. Furthermore, Hajek Philosophical Review 112, 2003 has shown that reformulations of Pascals Wager that address these criticisms inevitably lead to arguments that are philosophically unsatisfying and historically unfaithful. Both the objections and Hajeks philosophical worries disappear, however, if we represent our preferences using relative utilities generalized utility ratios rather than a one-place utility function. Relative utilities provide a conservative way to make sense of infinite value that preserves the familiar equation of rationality with the maximization of expected utility. They also provide a means of investigating a broader class of problems related to the Wager.','<b>Title: </b>PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES AND FORMAL ONTOLOGY<br><b>Year: </b>1994<br><b>Author: </b> Se.

This construal of the selected effects theory conflicts with the existence and ubiquity of neurobiological functions that are evolutionary novel, such as structures underlying reading ability. This conflict has suggested to some that, while the selected effects theory may be relevant to some areas of evolutionary biology, its relevance to neuroscience is marginal. This line of reasoning, however, neglects the fact that synapses, entire neurons, and potentially groups of neurons can undergo a type of selection analogous to natural selection operating over an evolutionary time scale. In the following, I argue that neural selection should be construed, by the selected effect theorist, as a distinct type of function-bestowing process in addition to natural selection. After explicating a generalized selected effects theory of function and distinguishing it from similar attempts to extend the selected effects theory, I do four things. First, I show how it allows one to identify neural selection as a distinct function-bestowing process, in contrast to other forms of neural structure formation such as neural construction. Second, I defend the view from one major criticism, and in so doing I clarify the content of the view. Third, I examine drug addiction to show the potential relevance of neural selection to neuroscientific and psychological research. Finally, I endorse a modest pluralism of function concepts within biology.','<b>Title: </b>Introspective forgetting<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> H. Van Ditmarsch,  A. Herzig,  J.

I then argue for the incompatibility of i a view entailed by Open Theism, viz., that there are no true counterfactuals of freedom, ii a popular form of process reliabilism about justification and knowledge, and iii a weak anti-skepticism about testimonial justification and knowledge.

The safety condition has been a very popular necessary condition for knowledge of late. However, it is well documented that the safety condition is trivially satisfied in cases where the subject believes in a necessary truth. This is for the simple reason that a necessary truth is true in all possible worlds, and therefore it is true in all possible worlds where it is believed. But clearly, all beliefs concerning necessary truths do not amount to knowledge. The safety theorists have attempted to deal with the problem caused by necessary truths by restricting the safety condition to purely contingent truths and by globalizing the safety condition to a set of propositions. Both of these solutions are problematic. The principal aim of this paper is to develop a version of the safety condition that is able to deal with cases featuring necessary truths.','nan','<b>Title: </b>A New Approach to Argument by Analogy: Extrapolation and Chain Graphs<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> D.

The conceptualist tradition, marshalled in by Chomsky and others, holds that infinity is a core explanandum and a link to the formal sciences. Realism/Platonism takes this further to argue that linguistics is in fact a formal science with an abstract ontology. In this paper, I argue that a central misconstrual of formal apparatus of recursive operations such as the set-theoretic operation merge has led to a mathematisation of the object of inquiry, producing a strong analogy with discrete mathematics and especially arithmetic. The main product of this error has been the assumption that natural, like some formal, languages are discretely infinite. I will offer an alternative means of capturing the insights and observations related to this posit in terms of scientific modelling. My chief aim will be to draw from the larger philosophy of science literature in order to offer a position of grammars as models compatible with various foundational interpretations of linguistics while being informed by contemporary ideas on scientific modelling for the natural and social sciences.','<b>Title: </b>Developmental Process Reliabilism: on Justification, Defeat, and Evidence<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> Ms. Bedke<br><b>Journal: </b>ERKENNTNIS<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>Here I present and defend an etiological theory of objective, doxastic justification, and related theories of defeat and evidence.

I shall argue that there are two principles directly connected to the two well-known theorems of Emmy Noether concerning global and local symmetries of the free matter-field Lagrangian, in the following referred to as conservation principle and gauge principle. Since both express nothing but certain symmetry features of the free field theory, they are not sufficient to derive a true interaction coupling to a new gauge field. For this purpose it is necessary to advocate a third, truly empirical principle which may be understood as a generalization of the equivalence principle. The second task of the paper is to deal with the ontological question concerning the reality status of gauge potentials in the light of the proposed logical structure of gauge theories. A nonlocal interpretation of topological effects in gauge theories and, thus, the non-reality of gauge potentials in accordance with the generalized equivalence principle will be favored.','<b>Title: </b>Synthesizing activities and interactions in the concept of a mechanism<br><b>Year: </b>2004<br><b>Author: </b> Jg.

Glennan considers mechanisms to be an interaction of parts, where the interaction between parts can be characterized by direct, invariant, change-relating generalizations. Machamer, Darden, and Craver criticize traditional conceptualizations of mechanisms which are based solely on parts interacting and introduce a new concept-activity. This essay is an attempt at carving out a relationship between these two philosophical interpretations of a mechanism. I will claim that, rather than being in conflict, Glennans concept of interaction and Machamer, Darden, and Cravers notion of activity actually complement one another, each emphasizing a missing element of the other.','<b>Title: </b>Artificial versus Substantial Gauge Symmetries: A Criterion and an Application to the Electroweak Model<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> J.

The attempt miscarried, because in its role as a contextual definition HP fails to fix uniquely the reference of the cardinality operator the number of Fs. This problem of referential indeterminacy is usually called the Julius Caesar problem. In this paper, Freges treatment of the problem in Grundlagen is critically assessed. In particular, I try to shed new light on it by paying special attention to the framework of his logicism in which it appears embedded. I argue, among other things, that the Caesar problem, which is supposed to stem from Freges tentative inductive definition of the natural numbers, is only spurious, not genuine; that the genuine Caesar problem deriving from HP is a purely semantic one and that the prospects of removing it by explicitly defining cardinal numbers as objects which are not classes are presumably poor for Frege. I conclude by rejecting two closely connected these concerning Caesar put forward by Richard Heck: i that Frege could not abandon Axiom V because he could not solve the Julius Caesar problem without it; ii that by his own lights for logicist programme in Grundgesetze der Arithmetik failed because he could not overcome that problem.','<b>Title: </b>Are Sensory Concepts Learned by Abstraction from Experience<br><b>Year: </b>2019<br><b>Author: </b> P.

But on other ways of specifying such a distinction, we can and do sometimes learn a concept of blue from experiences of blue. The latter part of the argument connects with some traditional abstractionist views, and I defend the present claims in view of some widely circulated concerns about abstracting concepts from experience.

We show how Hodges semantics can be seen as a special case of a general construction, which provides a context for a useful completeness theorem with respect to a wider class of models. We shed some new light on each aspect of the logic. We show that the natural propositional logic carried by the semantics is the logic of Bunched Implications due to Pym and OHearn, which combines intuitionistic and multiplicative connectives. This introduces several new connectives not previously considered in logics of informational dependence, but which we show play a very natural rA  le, most notably intuitionistic implication. As regards the quantifiers, we show that their interpretation in the Hodges semantics is forced, in that they are the image under the general construction of the usual Tarski semantics; this implies that they are adjoints to substitution, and hence uniquely determined. As for the dependence predicate, we show that this is definable from a simpler predicate, of constancy or dependence on nothing. This makes essential use of the intuitionistic implication. The Armstrong axioms for functional dependence are then recovered as a standard set of axioms for intuitionistic implication. We also prove a full abstraction result in the style of Hodges, in which the intuitionistic implication plays a very natural rA  le.','<b>Title: </b>Conditionals and Actuality<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> T.

For a subjunctive conditional, the natural conclusion to draw is that it is non-congruential. It is much harder to defend the claim that an indicative conditional is non-congruential.

This is the doctrine according to which, not only are some facts about substance composition metaphysically necessary, but, in addition, some facts about substance behavior are metaphysically necessary. More specifically, so goes the argument, not only is water necessarily composed of H2O and salt is necessarily composed of NaCl, but, in addition, salt necessarily dissolves in water. If this argument is sound, and if the statement that necessarily salt dissolves in water is a statement of a law of nature, then one conclusion of the argument is that there is at least one metaphysically necessary law of nature. My paper examines the extent to which this kind of argument could be generalized to provide a case for a full-blown scientific essentialism: the doctrine according to which all of the laws of nature are necessary. Or, in terms of dispositions, it is the doctrine according to which natural kinds have all of their powers, capacities and propensities as a matter of necessity.','<b>Title: </b>Abstract argumentation and explanation applied to scientific debates<br><b>Year: </b>2013<br><b>Author: </b> D.

This paper seeks to understand what the position could amount to and some of the challenges faced by its formulation and defence. I consider in detail Beall and Restalls Logical Pluralism-which seeks to accommodate radically different logics by stressing the way that they each fit a general form, the Generalised Tarski Thesis GTT-arguing against the claim that different instances of GTT are admissible precisifications of logical consequence. I then consider what it is to endorse a logic within a pluralist framework and criticise the options Beall and Restall entertain. A case study involving many-valued logics is examined. I next turn to issues of the applications of different logics and questions of which logic a pluralist should use in particular contexts. A dilemma regarding the applicability of admissible logics is tackled and it is argued that application is a red herring in relation to both understanding and defending a plausible form of logical pluralism. In the final section, I consider other ways to be and not to be a logical pluralist by examining analogous positions in debates over religious pluralism: this, I maintain, illustrates further limitations and challenges for a very general logical pluralism. Certain less wide-ranging pluralist positions are more plausible in both cases, I suggest, but assessment of those positions needs to be undertaken on a case-by-case basis.','<b>Title: </b>An impossibility theorem for verisimilitude<br><b>Year: </b>2007<br><b>Author: </b> Sd.

Nonetheless, we argue that ordinary speakers believe the propositions expressed by certain sentences of linguistic theory, and that linguistics can therefore teach us something about belief as well as language. Rather than insisting that ordinary speakers lack the linguistic beliefs in question, philosophers should try to show how these empirically motivated belief ascriptions can be correct. We argue that Stalnakers 1984 pragmatic account-according to which beliefs are dispositions, and propositions are sets of possible worlds-does just this. Moreover, our construal of explanation in linguistics motivates and helps provide responses to two difficulties for the pragmatic account of belief: the phenomenon of opacity, and the so-called problem of deduction.','<b>Title: </b>Is folk psychology different<br><b>Year: </b>2002<br><b>Author: </b> J.

My strategy involves arguing both against the extant arguments for the idea that FP must be construed as giving such explanations, and also against the very notion of such a different kind of explanation. I argue first that the in some sense a priori and conceptual nature of folk psychological principles does not support the idea that these are other than empirical generalisations, by appeal to recent nativist ideas in cognitive science and to Lewiss conception of the meaning of theoretical terms. Second, I argue that there is no coherent sense in which folk psychological explanations can be seen as normative.

In response to the first, we spell out the links between the recognition of numerical terms as vehicles of singular reference and the conception of numbers as possible objects of singular, or object-directed, thought, and the role of the acknowledgement of numbers as objects in the neo-Fregean attempt to justify the basic laws of arithmetic. In response to the second, we argue that the crucial issue concerns the capacity of either stipulation-of Humes Principle, or of the Dedekind-Peano axioms-to found knowledge of the principles involved, and that in this regard there are crucial differences which explain why the former stipulation can, but the latter cannot, play the required foundational role.','<b>Title: </b>Freges cardinals as concept-correlates Cardinal numbers<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> G.

Taking this early theory to have been an account of cardinals as second-level functions, this paper works out the significance of the fact that Freges cardinal numbers as objects is a theory of concept-correlates. Frege held that, where n > 2, there is a one-one correlation between each n-level function and an n-1 level function, and a one-one correlation between each first-level function and an object a course-of-values of the function. Applied to cardinals, the correlation offers new answers to some perplexing features of Freges philosophy. It is shown that within Freges concept-script, a generalized form of Humes Principle is equivalent to Russells Principle of Abstraction - a principle Russell employed to demonstrate the inadequacy of definition by abstraction. Accordingly, Freges rejection of definition of cardinal number by Humes Principle parallels Russells objection to definition by abstraction. Freges correlation thesis reveals that he has a way of meeting the structuralist challenge later revived by Benacerraf, 1965 that it is arithmetic, and not a privileged progression of objects, that matters to the finite cardinals.','<b>Title: </b>Incomplete understanding of complex numbers Girolamo Cardano: a case study in the acquisition of mathematical concepts<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> D.

I then use random sampling from the data set to develop and test a classification scheme for scientific explanation. My results show that explanation and inference to the best explanation are ubiquitous in science, that they occur across a wide range of scientific disciplines, and that they are a goal of scientific practise. These explanations and inferences to the best explanation come in a diversity forms, which at least partially justifies the fragmentation of philosophical accounts. I draw two methodological lessons: first that text mining can enhance traditional conceptual analysis by establishing facts about word usage; and second that random sampling of cases can increase our confidence that a philosophical account applies in general.

There is a fundamental mistake on both sides: a false dichotomy between bodily continuity versus psychological continuity theories of personal identity. Neo-Lockeans, like everyone else today who relies on Lockes analysis of personal identity, including Derek Parfit, have either completely distorted or not understood Lockes actual view. Shoemakers defense, which uses a package deal definition that relies on internal relations of synchronic and diachronic unity and employs the Ramsey-Lewis account to define personal identity, leaves far less room for psychological continuity views than for my own view, which, independently of its radical implications, is that a consciousness makes personal identity, and b in consciousness alone personal identity consists-which happens to be also Lockes actual view. Moreover, the ubiquitous Fregean conception of borders and the so-called ambiguity of is collapse in the light of what Hintikka has called the Frege trichotomy. The Ramsey-Lewis account, due to the problematic way Shoemaker tries to bind the variables, makes it impossible for the neo-Lockean ala Shoemaker to fulfill the uniqueness clause required by all such Lewis style definitions; such attempts avoid circularity only at the expense of mistaking isomorphism with identity. Contrary to what virtually all philosophers writing on the topic assume, fission does not destroy personal identity. A proper analysis of public versus perspectival identification, derived using actual case studies from neuropsychiatry, provides the scientific, mathematical and logical frameworks for a new theory of self-reference, wherein consciousness, self-consciousness, and the I, can be precisely defined in terms of the subject and the subject-in-itself.','<b>Title: </b>Representational unification in cognitive science: Is embodied cognition a unifying perspective<br><b>Year: </b><br><b>Author: </b> M.

This is not in itself an argument against the correctness of the analysis. But by requiring us to have causal knowledge prior to making any judgements about causation, Woodwards theory does make it mysterious how we can ever start acquiring causal knowledge. We present a solution to this problem by showing how the interventionist notion of causation can be rationally generated from a more primitive agency notion of causation. The agency notion is easily and non-circularly applicable, but fails when we attempt to capture causal relations between non-actions. We show that the interventionist notion of causation serves as an appropriate generalisation of the agency notion. Furthermore, the causal judgements based on the latter generally remain true when rephrased in terms of the former, which allows one to use the causal knowledge gained by applying the agency notion as a basis for applying Woodwards interventionist theory. We then present an overview of relevant empirical evidence from developmental psychology which shows that our proposed rational reconstruction lines up neatly with the actual development of causal reasoning in children. This gives additional plausibility to our proposal. The article thus provides a solution to one of the main problems of interventionism while keeping Woodwards analysis intact.','<b>Title: </b>Model checking techniqes for the analysis of reactive systems<br><b>Year: </b>2002<br><b>Author: </b> S.

Contrary to both, I apply insights about the psychology of human perception and concept-formation to a very traditional epistemological project: the foundationalist approach to the epistemic regress problem. I argue that direct realism about perception can help solve the regress problem and support a foundationalist account of justification, but only if it is supplemented by an abstractionist theory of concept-formation, the view that it is possible to abstract concepts directly from the empirically given. Critics of direct realism like Laurence BonJour are correct that an account of direct perception by itself does not provide an adequate account of justification. However a direct realist account of perception can inform the needed theory of concept-formation, and leading critics of abstractionism like McDowell and Sellars, direct realists about perception themselves, fail to appreciate the ways in which their own views about perception help fill gaps in earlier accounts of abstractionism.

Yet there are sciences, theoretical population biology in particular, that explain their phenomena by appeal to statistical, non-causal properties of ensembles. I develop a generalised account of explanation. An explanation serves two functions: metaphysical and cognitive. The metaphysical function is discharged by identifying a counterfactually robust invariance relation between explanans event and explanandum. The cognitive function is discharged by providing an appropriate description of this relation. I offer examples of explanations from portfolio theory and population genetics that meet this characterisation. In each case the invariance relation holds between a statistical property of an ensemble and a change in structure of the ensemble. In neither case, however, does the statistical property cause the outcome it explains. There are genuine statistical, non-causal scientific explanations.','<b>Title: </b>Minimalism, the generalization problem and the liar<br><b>Year: </b>2004<br><b>Author: </b> B.

We focus on two aspects of holism. The first refers to the involvement of comprehensive complexes of hypotheses in the theoretical treatment of systems regarded in isolation. By contrast, the second refers to the correlation between the theoretical descriptions of different systems. It is demonstrated how these two aspects can be analysed by making use of the structuralist notion of theory-nets, and how they are reflected by a refined version of the Ramsey sentence. Furthermore, it is argued that there exists a tight correlation between the occurrence of these two holistic phenomena, a specific form of underdetermination of terms which occur in the fundamental principles of an empirical theory, and the shaping of the theorys protective belt. After having dealt with these questions in abstracto, the relevance of these considerations for a better understanding of the dynamics of empirical theories is demonstrated in a concrete case study.

One result is that central arguments put forth by ontic theorists against epistemic theorists are revealed as not only question-begging, but ultimately self-defeating. Another result is that a more nuanced reconciliation of the epistemic and ontic views is required: we should regard good explanatory practice as a dynamic process with distinct phases of epistemic and ontic success.','<b>Title: </b>Merging inference and conjecture by information<br><b>Year: </b>2002<br><b>Author: </b> Ic.

This happens for instance in some treatments of verisimilitude. We expound an abstract mathematical rendering of the relevant data-dependent relation in the framework of Boolean algebras. For every element t of a Boolean algebra B we construct the t-modulated Boolean algebra B-t in which the order relation represents is at most as compatible with t as or is at best as similar to t as. In the case of Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras, t expresses the available information, and the compatibility relation turns out to be an entwinement of inferential and conjectural relations. It is just classical entailment when no information is available i.e., when t is logically true and becomes more boldly abductive the more information is available. The rich algebraic structures of a Boolean algebra -- including its Boolean group structures -- play a significant role in this combination of deduction and abduction and also induce cautious and daring variants of the compatibility relation.

Hintikka has argued that the two notions should be effective and that one should thus restrict ones attention to recursive winning strategies. In the context of arithmetic, we show that the two notions do not coincide: on the one hand, proofs in PA do not yield recursive winning strategies for the associated game; on the other hand, there is no sound and effective proof procedure that captures recursive GTS truths. We then consider a generalized version of Game Theoretical Semantics by introducing games with backward moves. In this setting, a connection is made between proofs and recursive winning strategies.

A typical scenario for the belief merging problem is one in which several agents pool their beliefs together to form a consistent group picture of the world. The aim of this paper is to define and study new notions of equilibria in belief merging. To do so, we assume the agents arrive at consistency via the use of a social belief removal function, in which each agent, using his own individual removal function, removes some belief from his stock of beliefs. We examine several notions of equilibria in this setting, assuming a general framework for individual belief removal due to Booth et al. We look at their inter-relations as well as prove their existence or otherwise. We also show how our equilibria can be seen as a generalisation of the idea of taking maximal consistent subsets of agents.','<b>Title: </b>Judgment aggregation and the problem of tracking the truth<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> S.

In other words, we address the problem of tracking the truth. We set up a probabilistic model that generalizes the analysis of Bovens and Rabinowicz Synthese 150: 131-153, 2006 and use it to compare several aggregation procedures. Demanding some reasonable adequacy constraints, we demonstrate that a reasons- or premise-based aggregation procedure tracks the truth better than any other procedure. However, we also illuminate that such a procedure is not in all circumstances easy to implement, leaving actual decision-makers with a tradeoff problem.','<b>Title: </b>Toward a very idea of representation<br><b>Year: </b>2001<br><b>Author: </b> G.

This paper argues to the contrary. Starting from Quines assumption that the meanings of observation sentences are stimulus meanings, i.e., set-theoretical constructions of neuronal states uniquely determined by inter-subjectively observable facts, the paper shows that this meaning assignment, up to isomorphism, is uniquely extendable to all expressions that occur in observation sentences. To do so, a theorem recently proven by Hodges is used. To derive the conclusion, one only has to assume that languages are compositional, abide by a generalized context principle and by what I call the category principle. These assumptions originating in Frege and Husserl are coherent with Quines overall position. It is concluded that Quines naturalistic approach does not justify scepticism with regard to meaning, but should rather result in a view that affiliates semantics with neuroscience.','<b>Title: </b>Evidential Holism and Indispensability Arguments<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> J.

In this paper I argue that the dominant reasons for rejecting the holistic indispensability argument are mistaken. This is largely due to an overestimation of the consequences that follow from evidential holism. Nevertheless, the holistic indispensability argument should be rejected, but for a different reason A 3-in order that an indispensability argument relying on holism can work, it must invoke an unmotivated version of evidential holism. Such an argument will be unsound. Correcting the argument with a proper construal of evidential holism means that it can no longer deliver mathematical Platonism as a conclusion: such an argument for Platonism will be invalid. I then show how the reasons for rejecting the holistic indispensability argument importantly constrain what kind of account of explanation will be permissible in explanatory versions A 4.','<b>Title: </b>Computational neuroscience and localized neural function<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> Dc. Burnston<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>In this paper I criticize a view of functional localization in neuroscience, which I call computational absolutism CA. Absolutism in general is the view that each part of the brain should be given a single, univocal function ascription. Traditional varieties of absolutism posit that each part of the brain processes a particular type of information and/or performs a specific task. These function attributions are currently beset by physiological evidence which seems to suggest that brain areas are multifunctional-that they process distinct information and perform different tasks depending on context. Many theorists take this contextual variation as inimical to successful localization, and claim that we can avoid it by changing our functional descriptions to computational descriptions. The idea is that we can have highly generalizable and predictive functional theories if we can discover a single computation performed by each area regardless of the specific context in which it operates. I argue, drawing on computational models of perceptual area MT, that this computational version of absolutism fails to come through on its promises. In MT, the modeling field has not produced a univocal computational description, but instead a plurality of models analyzing different aspects of MT function. Moreover, CA cannot appeal to theoretical unification to solve this problem, since highly general models, on their own, neither explain nor predict what MT does in any particular context. I close by offering a perspective on neural modeling inspired by Nancy Cartwrights and Margaret Morrisons views of modeling in the physical sciences.','<b>Title: </b>The emergence of the macroworld: A study of intertheory relations in classical and quantum mechanics<br><b>Year: </b>2003<br><b>Author: </b> Mr. Forster and  A.

Specifically, measure theory affords a natural and quantitative way of describing local spaces of possibility. The generality of models can be understood as the measure of possibilities to which the models apply.

The strategy is held to meet the minimal requirements for identifying the residual errors in particular equations in the model with independent, though otherwise not directly observable, exogenous causes shocks that ultimately account for change in the model. In nonstationary models, such shocks accumulate so that variables have discernible trends. Econometricians have conceived of variables that trend in sympathy with each other so-called cointegrated variables as sharing one or more of these unobserved trends as a common cause. It is possible for estimates of the values of both the otherwise unobservable individual shocks and the otherwise unobservable common trends to be backed-out of cointegrated systems of equations. The issue addressed in this paper is whether and in what circumstances these values can be regarded as observations of real entities rather than merely artifacts of the representation of variables in the model. The issue is related, on the one hand, to practical methodological problems in the use of SVARs for policy analysis-e.g., does it make sense to estimate of shocks or trends in one model and then use them as measures of variables in a conceptually distinct model The issue is also related to debates in the philosophical analysis of causation-particularly, whether we are entitled, as assumed by the developers of Bayes-net approaches, to rely on the causal Markov condition a generalization of Reichenbachs common-cause condition or whether cointegration generates a practical example of Nancy Cartwrights byproducts objection to the causal Markov condition.','<b>Title: </b>Intersubstitutivity principles and the generalization function of truth<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> A.

I then raise a series of problems for the abstraction that ultimately have serious repercussions for realism about propositions in general. I first identify problems about the number of entities able to be abstracted using these techniques. I then focus on how issues of language relativity result in problems akin to the Caesar problem in arithmetic by exposing circularity and modal concern over the status of the criterion of identity for propositions.','<b>Title: </b>The Alice in Wonderland mechanics of the rejection of climate science: simulating coherence by conspiracism<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> S.

For example, the findings from climate science form a highly coherent body of knowledge that is supported by many independent lines of evidence: greenhouse gas GHG emissions from human economic activities are causing the global climate to warm and unless GHG emissions are drastically reduced in the near future, the risks from climate change will continue to grow and major adverse consequences will become unavoidable. People who oppose this scientific body of knowledge because the implications of cutting GHG emissions-such as regulation or increased taxation-threaten their worldview or livelihood cannot provide an alternative view that is coherent by the standards of conventional scientific thinking. Instead, we suggest that people who reject the fact that the Earths climate is changing due to greenhouse gas emissions or any other body of well-established scientific knowledge oppose whatever inconvenient finding they are confronting in piece-meal fashion, rather than systematically, and without considering the implications of this rejection to the rest of the relevant scientific theory and findings. Hence, claims that the globe is cooling can coexist with claims that the observed warming is natural and that the human influence does not matter because warming is good for us. Coherence between these mutually contradictory opinions can only be achieved at a highly abstract level, namely that something must be wrong with the scientific evidence in order to justify a political position against climate change mitigation. This high-level coherence accompanied by contradictory subordinate propositions is a known attribute of conspiracist ideation, and conspiracism may be implicated when people reject well-established scientific propositions.','<b>Title: </b>Plural quantifiers: a modal interpretation<br><b>Year: </b>2014<br><b>Author: </b> R.

The main motivation for this view is that plural quantification has to be given some sort of semantics, and among the two main candidates-substitutional and set-theoretic-only the latter can provide the language of plurals with the desired expressive power given that the nominalist seems committed to the assumption that there can be at most countably many names.

I argue for two claims intended to advance our understanding of singular thought about mathematical abstracta. First, that the conditions for possession of a file for an abstract mathematical object are the same as the conditions for possessing a file for an object perceived in the past-namely, that the agent retains information about the object. Thus insofar as we are able to have memory-based files for objects perceived in the past, we ought to be able to have files for abstract mathematical objects too. Second, at least one recently articulated condition on a files being a device for singular thought-that it be capable of surviving a certain kind of change in the information it contains-can be satisfied by files for abstract mathematical objects.','<b>Title: </b>Cartesian epistemology and infallible justification<br><b>Year: </b>2018<br><b>Author: </b> R.

The discussion includes a critical examination of some controversial views put forward mainly by Robin Jeshion, Tyler Burge, Crispin Wright, Richard Heck and John MacFarlane. In the introductory section, I try to shed light on the connection between logical abstraction and logical objects. The second section contains a critical appraisal of Freges notion of evidence and its interpretation by Jeshion, the introduction of the course-of-values operator and Freges attitude towards Axiom V, in the expression of which this operator occurs as the key primitive term. Axiom V says that the course-of-values of the function f is identical with the course-of-values of the function g if and only if f and g are coextensional. In the third section, I intend to show that in Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik 1884 Frege hardly could have construed Humes Principle HP as a primitive truth of logic and used it as an axiom governing the cardinality operator as a primitive sign. HP expresses that the number of Fs is identical with the number of Gs if and only if F and G are equinumerous. In the fourth section, I argue that Wright falls short of making a convincing case for the alleged analyticity of HP. In the final section, I canvass Hecks arguments for his contention that Frege knew he could deduce the simplest laws of arithmetic from HP without invoking Axiom V. I argue that they do not carry conviction. I conclude this section by rejecting an interpretation concerning HP suggested by MacFarlane.','<b>Title: </b>Action emulation<br><b>Year: </b>2012<br><b>Author: </b> J. Van Eijck,  J. Ruan and  T.

There is a natural extension of the definition of a bisimulation to action models. Surely enough, updating with bisimilar action models gives the same result modulo bisimulation. But the converse turns out to be false: update models may have the same update effects without being bisimilar. We propose action emulation as a notion of equivalence more appropriate for action models, and generalizing standard bisimulation. It is proved that action emulation provides a full characterization of update effect. We first concentrate on the general case, and next focus on the important case of action models with propositional preconditions. Our notion of action emulation yields a simplification procedure for action models, and it gives designers of multi-agent systems a useful tool for comparing different ways of representing a particular communicative action.','<b>Title: </b>Against digital ontology<br><b>Year: </b>2009<br><b>Author: </b> L.

Borsboom et al.

Hood Erkenntnis, 784:739-761 2013 deemphasized Borsboom et al.s position and argued that the choice of a reflective measurement model does not necessarily require ontological commitments, though, in his view, it does necessitate a commitment to minimal epistemic realism. Although these arguments are formulated with regard to psychological research, they can actually be generalized to other disciplines in social sciences that use similar methodologies and statistical techniques. In Hoods opinion, empiricism does not suffice to provide an adequate account of the choice of reflective measurement models given that this choice requires an appeal to causal explanations. In this paper, we argue against Hood and answer this challenge, providing epistemic foundations for social science research that do not appeal to realism.','<b>Title: </b>On the metaphysics of linguistics Dualism<br><b>Year: </b>2006<br><b>Author: </b> W.

Our argument departs from the empirical observation that the linguistic mind gives rise to hierarchies of semantic complexity that we argue only follow from constraints of an essentially mathematical kind. We assume that the faculty of language tightly correlates with the mathematical capacity both formally and in evolution, the latter plausibly arising as an abstraction from the former, as a kind of specialized output. On this basis, and since the semantic hierarchies in question are mirrored in the syntactic complexity of the expression involved, we posit the existence,of a higher-dimensional syntax structured on the model of the hierarchy of numbers, in order to explain the semantic facts in question. If so, syntax does not have a physicalist interpretation any more than the hierarchy of number-theoretic spaces does.','<b>Title: </b>New life for Carnaps Aufbau<br><b>Year: </b>2011<br><b>Author: </b> H.

John Greco suggests that in order to deal with Gettier-type cases, a virtue analysis of knowing should include a requirement that ones knowing does not in a certain way involve abnormality. Yet Grecos emphasis on statistical abnormality either renders his analysis subject to a generality problem or to objections regarding certain Gettier-type cases. When we instead consider abnormality in the sense of a causally differentiating factor in relation to a causal contrast situation, the account remains unclear concerning its application to an interesting non-Gettier-type case concerning chance. The exploration of these shortcomings casts doubt on the epistemological usefulness of the schema, If you know, then there is no abnormality in your being right.','<b>Title: </b>A generalized definition of Bells local causality<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> G.

Bells original idea of local causality will then arise as the classical case of our definition. First, we investigate what is needed for a local physical theory to be locally causal. Then we compare local causality with Reichenbachs common cause principle and relate both to the Bell inequalities. We find a nice parallelism: both local causality and the common cause principle are more general notions than captured by the Bell inequalities. Namely, Bell inequalities cannot be derived neither from local causality nor from a common cause unless the local physical theory is classical or the common cause is commuting, respectively.','<b>Title: </b>Conditional choice with a vacuous second tier<br><b>Year: </b>2016<br><b>Author: </b> Rt. Stewart<br><b>Journal: </b>SYNTHESE<br><b>Cluster-Keywords: </b><em>noise<br><b>Abstract: </b><em>This paper studies a generalization of rational choice theory. I briefly review the motivations that Helzner gives for his conditional choice construction 2013. Then, I focus on the important class of conditional choice functions with vacuous second tiers. This class is interesting for both formal and philosophical reasons. I argue that this class makes explicit one of conditional choices normative motivations in terms of an account of neutrality advocated within a certain tradition in decision theory. The observations recorded-several of which are generalizations of central results in the standard theory of rational choice-are intended to provide further insight into how conditional choice generalizes the standard account and are offered as additional evidence of the fruitfulness of the conditional choice framework.','<b>Title: </b>Causes without Mechanisms: Experimental Regularities, Physical Laws, and Neuroscientific Explanation<br><b>Year: </b>2008<br><b>Author: </b> M.

I show that the fact that the model was partly fitted to experimental data did not affect its explanatory status, nor did the false mechanistic assumptions made by Hodgkin and Huxley. The model satisfies two important criteria of explanatory status: it contains invariant generalizations and it is modular both in James Woodwards sense. Further, I argue that there is a sense in which the explanatory heteronomy thesis holds true for this case.','<b>Title: </b>Species Have Partly Intrinsic Essences<br><b>Year: </b>2010<br><b>Author: </b> M.

The consensus among philosophers of biology is that such essentialism is deeply wrong, indeed incompatible with Darwinism. I argue that biological generalizations about the morphology, physiology, and behavior of species require structural explanations that must advert to these essential properties. The paper concludes by summarizing my responses to the objection that, according to current species concepts, species are relational, and to the objection that essentialism cannot accommodate features of Darwinism associated with variation and change.'],
